I don't know how I never thought to come here during all those twenty-some years I lived in the South Hills. I mean, I guess I do know why and it's because the place doesn't look fancy on the outside (and neither is it on the inside). The front is a deli, so unless you want a pound of chipped ham or whatever meat and cheeses you need for your lunches, you wouldn't think to come in. Beyond the deli counter is a separate room that houses the kitchen and the dining room. It looks like a cafeteria, but I would definitely not call their food cafeteria food. Simple concept: you order at the counter, they give you a number and they bring your food to you when it's ready.\n\nMy husband and I were in the area and after reading other reviews, we both went with the Broasted Chicken Dinner. For $8.29, it comes with cole slaw and a choice of potato; I got the broasted and he got the mashed. The chicken dinner seriously is half a chicken: you get a thigh, a breast and a whole wing. Whatever magic they're doing in the kitchen, this chicken is crunchy on the outside, so incredibly moist on the inside and it's seasoned to perfection. Forget KFC, this is the place to go for breaded chicken and for an incredibly affordable price too. The cole slaw was delicious, mostly tangy and sweet, and just the slightest bit creamy. The broasted potatoes, which are just wedge potatoes, were pretty darn good. Again, crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. Perfection. \n\nAlthough it's not very fancy, the food is just fantastic for the price.

Why we have never tried it I am not sure.  FINALLY we went in for lunch.  It was actually quite surprising!  The first part fo the place is a deli.  They don't make individual sandwiches but they sell Boar's Head deli meats and also offer fresh buns.  You walk through the deli to get to the restaurant.  They have quite a selection.  I chose the Chicken Parm sandwich.  It came with chips and a pickle.  They had soups and daily specials.  They also have a nice little salad bar.  They even have a nice selection of desserts.  The sandwich was delivered to my table and it was freshly cooked.  It wasn't a chicken patty that was pressed chicken.  It was real chicken.  100%.  It had been flattened out a bit so the pieces were thinner and not huge pieces that would be hard to bite into.  There were 2 chicken patties on the sandwich.  The roll was fresh and stood up to the contents.  It had lots of gooey melty cheese and the marinara was really good.  My husband had the Cajun chicken sandwich.  It was just as good.  It wasn't spicy like Cajun can be sometimes, but it had a great Cajun flavor.  His sandwich came with French fries.  I may or may not have helped him eat his because they were so good.  We each took half of our sandwiches home to have for dinner.  We also each grabbed a dessert.  I'm a big fan of coconut cream pie so I picked up a piece of that .  I had am sad to say that it was disappointing.  It had no actual coconut in it.  It was just flavored.  However, my hubby got the Boston Creme Cake and loved it.  You can have broasted chicken for your meal but it takes around 20-30 minutes because they make it fresh.  We passed on it this time but we are having a family dinner next weekend and we are going to order the broasted chicken for that.  They have sides you can buy in the deli.

What we found was a restaurant and store combo that looks like it's been in this spot for a long while, in a good way. We entered into the store part, not knowing that the restaurant is in the back, and were greeted by a friendly and helpful guy who actually introduced himself to us with a handshake...this even before he knew it was our first time in. He directed us to the restaurant once he learned we intended on dining in, and we headed back to find more counter service, a salad bar and a diner like atmosphere. We helped ourselves to the salad bar and ordered some chicken, which they cook up fresh for you. The chicken takes at least 15 minutes, so we'll know to plan on this for our next visit, or perhaps call ahead. \n\nThe salad bar is nice, with lots of choices and some tasty cole slaw and potato salad. The chicken is the star here, however. Broasting is frying under pressure, and the meat absorbs less oil then in traditional frying. Crispy outside, juicy within, and very delicious. I tried a thigh and some wings, and liked it all. The hot sauce that comes with the wings is divine, and I will ask for this on my next visit even if I don't order the wings, as it goes well with all of the chicken parts. I will also try the broasted potatoes on my next visit, as these seem to have many fans here on Yelp. On our way out we passed tables that had ordered the pizza, so chicken isn't the only draw here.

All we ordered was 20 piece broasted chicken. It was great, fed us all, lots of meat, crispy and just how we wanted it. We picked up and it was easy. \n\nWe came here again after loving it from game night and ate in, not such a great experience.. I had already tried their chicken so I went with a fish sandwich. The sandwich was ready in less than 5 minutes which was great on the service end but I'm guessing it was not fresh fish. Also, I was expecting batter dipped and fried fish on my sandwich, I was sadly mistaken. It was more like a giant fish stick, I'm very big on fish sandwiches too, so I was sad. My bun was slightly moist all over and I was overall unhappy with my meal. \n\nAfter my craving not being satisfied for their chicken, we returned the next day and I ordered their broasted chicken to go. I was very pleased with the pricing on individual pieces and the portion you received. The things I was unhappy about was when we ordered before I paid, we were told it would be 10-15 minutes max because they're made fresh, which is great! I didn't mind at all, even though we were in a rush and needed to be out quickly, but I like fresh food. Then, after she swiped my card she told me it would actually be longer and that there was a call ahead order in front of me now and that he would try to squeeze my order in. I was not happy, but I sat patiently and waited. Finally after about 25-30 minutes, my chicken came to my table to go. Once I was in the car, I began to eat and my chicken was well under cooked, I was so disappointed, I really wanted it to be as good as the first time I had it. The chicken was very uncrispy and the meat was very very slimy and still pink in the middle. \n\nOverall, the parking is easy, good location, food is hit or miss, but I will be back and will hope for the best as I try again!

The hostess indicated this is something they plan to continue monthly with the menu options varying.\n\nWe made reservations and arrived early with no problems getting seated.  They have cordoned off a section of the cafe with a privacy partition for the guests with reservations while keeping the rest open for normal cafe operations.  The tables have tablecloths and the table is nicely set with wine glasses and beautiful napkins.  We started our meal with glasses of wine (price additional to the fixed price meal).  The first course was a warm artichoke and roasted red pepper risotto.  This was delicious and an ample serving.  \n\nI should interrupt here just as our diner was interrupted.  Suddenly a fire alarm went off in the building.  Everyone just looked at one another with no one moving.  Ok.... I was taught, as good measure, that one should get their butt up and head to the exit in such a case so I donned my coat and headed out.  I do think the staff should be better instructed to not only get their butts out the door but ensure their patrons do, as well.  That was irksome on a safety level.  Within 15 minutes, the all-clear was given (our server later indicated something in the basement had triggered it).  Anyway, I did my part and my husband followed suit a wee bit after me reluctantly and then we did finally return to our table.\n\nOk, onto the 2nd course.  The 2nd course was our choice of either a house salad or a mushroom soup.  I selected the salad while my husband opted for the soup.  Both were adequate but I should have asked for additional salad dressing (a vinaigrette)\n\nThe 3rd course was the entree -- I opted for the crab cake and asparagus, my husband selected the filet with asparagus.  Both were good.  I can't say the crab cake was like any other I've had, but it was good.\n\nThe 4th and final course was dessert -- a warn blueberry cobber with ice cream.  It was good but not as sweet as either of us would have liked.\n\nAfterwards, we had plenty of time to visit the gift shop and the convervatory which was sponsoring orchids and bonsai.  \n\nI like this concept of a very nice dinner and journey through the convervatory -- makes for a truly great date night.  Oh, and another plus?  When you are finished with dinner they give you your complementary conservatory ticket and it's good thru the end of the year -- not just that night.

Everything looked fresh and delicious and I was pumped to have some healthy options.  The execution of this menu, though, fell a little short.   \n\nI ordered a salad and a sandwich and a glass of wine.  The salad was quinoa, apples, lettuce, cheese, etc.  It was under-dressed and under-seasoned, but otherwise a good concept.   The sandwich was really where I had the problem.  The menu description didn't really say either way, but I sort of expected it to be hot since it was a grilled chicken variety.   It was served cold, though, which was fine.  What wasn't fine was the ratio of fixins to bread.  Way off.  I could barely taste the meat, sauce, etc. - there just wasn't enough of it and there was entirely too much bread.  And I am a bread lover, so that is saying something.  All of my companions who ordered sandwiches had the same problem.   Those who ordered soup fared better - the soups all got good reviews.  The quiche also looked really good.  I just can't get past that skimpy sandwich though.  \n\nAs far as seating, it was definitely limited.  I snagged a table in the back next to some really LOUD families.   It's a caf\u00e9, so I didn't mind it.

Combined with an actual trip into Phipps, and a meal here can easily be part of a perfect afternoon or evening.\n\nThe cafe itself is a lovely, bright, colorful part of Phipps' main lobby and floor. In my experience it's always been well maintained, i.e kept very clean with plants and candles put out on the tables. The framed photos of fields and fresh produce hanging on the walls just complete the cafe's fresh and vibrant look and feel.\n\nWhile the menu itself (and the ingredients of what's sold here) often changes with the season and availability of produce, the general idea of the menu is always the same - you can order or mix-and-match soups, salads, sandwiches, a couple entree-items at times, and a quiche of the day. There are also usually smaller bites and side dishes like fruit cups, as well as dessert options like cupcakes. And as far as I know, all of the items are made from fresh, organic, and local ingredients, or brought in from local vendors.\n\nAnd I have to say, nothing here has let me down. The soups in particular always impress me - you can tell that their tomato soup is freshly made and it's always very think and pulpy; I feel healthier and happier just looking at it! Their salads are always a lovely blend of veggies and dressing (and meat if you opt for it, although Phipps is very vegetarian friendly), and the sandwiches have been perfectly toasted and to die for in my experience. Honestly it's impossible for me to leave without a smile on my face after eating here, the ingredients used are just so wonderful and perfect together.\n\nOh, and since Phipps is one of the green leaders in town, it should come as no surprise that they aim to recycle and compost the few dishes and silverware items that can't be washed and reused.\n\nI seriously have no complaints about this little eatery. The best part about the cafe is that a visit to Phipps, while recommended, is not required.

The line was super long, and all the inside tables were bustling. This can be typical of downtown lunch time, but I decided to wait and give it a shot. I'm glad I did because the line moved quickly, and the food was really good. It's like a chipotle, but with way more options. They also have a ton of sauces and sides to put in little containers for when you eat your meal.\n\nI'd go back here for sure. I'd also recommend using the app to order to cut the line. Moe's definitely knew what they were doing with this remodel, and the counter is so long that they're able to take so many orders at once.

I think it's the combo of that friendly, \"Welcome to Moe's!\" along with fair prices and free chips that make your meal feel like a meal and, thus, a better value. I'm a vegetarian and every entree has a veggie or tofu option, and the tofu is well-seasoned and delicious. They also have the best queso of any of the fast Mexican places and it's not even close. This location spent a very long time remodeling but it's worth it thanks to the less crowded conditions while standing in line -- always long at lunch but moves quickly -- and the secret to-go nook next door. I say secret because it's separate from the restaurant and could be easy to miss, but what a great help to downtown workers in a hurry. Order on the app, give them 15 minutes and there's your order waiting, like magic, along with a salsa bar and drink fountain where you don't have to jockey for position during busy times like the main restaurant next door. Also worth downloading the app for -- you earn points that can be redeemed for free food in relatively short order, and a free entree for your birthday. Great rewards program.\n"}, {"author": "Jon F.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2017-09-18", "description": "We visited Pittsburgh for the first time last weekend and found Market Square, which is the obvious downtown destination spot.  We looked around for an authentic mexican joint but couldn't find what was online (closed, perhaps?) so we ended up going to Moe's.  Moe's is like Chipotle is like Baja Fresh is like QDoba...you get the idea.  These are all counter service establishments that serve cafeteria style - pick your type of food, your meats, your fillings and customize your order.\n\nI'm not generally a fan of this type of food and some of the things they get wrong like the rest of the chains do.  For example, they skimp on the meat - you get one spoon ladle full and the rest is fillings (I did not ask for double meat - you might try to!).  The meat itself is decent, but not what you're going to get with the places that do 'real mexican' - for example, I had carnitas but it wasn't anything like normal carnitas.  It felt like cafeteria food.\n\nWhat they do get right is the same as the chains too - the ingredients are all fresh, the quality is decent and you can get a variety.  We ate in so it came with chips and I dug a number of the salsas they had.  My Carnita taco was passable and my girflriend had what amounted to a crunchwrap that was pretty tasty.\n\nSo, if you know what to expect and aren't too demanding, you can get some good food here.

Who knows.\n\nI ordered the Julia Guilia stack ($7.22 w tax), which was essentially a vegetarian burrito panini with a hard taco inside.  The vegetarian version comes with free queso and free guacamole which is cool by me.  The wrap isn't overly flavorful, but being as it comes with chips and salsa, it is super cheap.  Speaking of salsa, the salsa bar has some nice options, and you can actually see tomatoes in the red salsa.  Move aside Chipotle and Qdoba, I think Moe's is way better.  The food is cheaper, there are more options, and it tastes better.\n\nOne issue: Why do they feel the need to do the \"Welcome to Moe's!\" thing?

The d\u00e9cor inside was simple, but it was clear the restaurant was kept clean. The seating arrangements were aged like fine wine, and it was evident that they had been used often, indicating the location's popularity. \nWe were greeted with a beaming smile from the location's proud owner, Jacob. He gleefully took our orders, and was quick to offer his pen when mine ran out of ink. That's just the kind of guy Jacob is. You know when you eat at Forbes Gyro that you're getting that famous Oakland hospitality that attracts students from all over the world. \nOne issue that arose amongst my associates was the notable absence of individual slices of pizza on the menu, but you know what they say: never order pizza in a gyro place. Either way, the menu was somewhat unclear, and even lead to some confusion amongst the group as to what was offered.\nI ended up opting for the classic lamb gyro, which arrived in a timely manner. My gyro was wrapped in a soft warm pita, and was filled with the delectable combination of juicy lamb, fresh lettuce, sliced tomatoes, and just a pinch of onions. Drizzled throughout the gyro was what one can only assume to be homemade tzatziki sauce. The lamb was tender and well-seasoned. \nI was enjoying my experience until I opted to sample my colleague's fries. Much to my chagrin, the fries were rather bland as initially served. When paired with the authentic Greek salt offered at each table, the quality of the side dish improved significantly. \nAll-in-all, Forbes Gyro was an unforgettable experience. My 45-minute expedition to the land of the Mediterranean ended abruptly when I stepped back out onto the mean streets of Oakland.

They just got rid of the owner problem.   \n\nSo why the one star?   A few things.  First, value.   I ordered a small mixed appetizer and a lamb kebab meal via Grubhub.   The total with tip came to almost $50 - for lunch.  This is way excessive, but I ordered anyway because I was in the mood for it.   For the price, you'd think the portions would be huge.   They are and they aren't.  The meat portion of my lamb kebab was scant - very little meat and cooked beyond well done.   The vegetable (zucchini) was a mere garnish, with two tiny spears.  Lots of rice though - go figure.  The pita portion was also scant for the amount of dips ordered in appetizer.   Guess you gotta pay for extra.   I would usually stretch this order into 2 meals and a snack, but with barely any meat and pita, it was more like one and then a bunch of waste.  \n\nThe packaging was also haphazard.  Two bags, one with warm pita on top of cold salad.  And the other with cold dips on top of the warm meal.   I didn't even know the salad was in there because it was buried under the pita (I assumed the pita bag contained a reasonable portion of pita and didn't think to look under it.  \n\nThe piece de resistance though.  After eating half of the mixed eggplant, I discover a bug mixed in.  Looked like a little beetle or something - possibly a baby roach.  Just gross.

It's not fair to compare Bagel Factory to a NYC bagel so I won't.  But if that is what you are craving, this will not fill that void.  I think the best bagel in Pittsburgh is a fair claim to fame, but Pittsburgh has some really bad bagels.  Just a thought.\n\nI ordered a rye bagel with bacon, egg, and cheese ($3.99).  There was a ton of good, thick bacon on the sandwich, and that was AMAZING.  Plenty of cheese and the perfect amount of egg as well.  But the bagel was pretty much flavorless.  Rye bagels should have flavor.  If this place wasn't called the bagel factory, it would be different.  But the bagel was so whatever.  The bagels are also really small for a fresh bagel.\n\nI would definitely come back to the Bagel Factory, but I think they really should work on creating a more memorable bagel.\n\nThey accept credit cards.\n"}, {"author": "Eliana B.", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2017-08-24", "description": "This place is almost always closed and there's no hours posted so i genuinely don't know when they're open. They happened to be today, and i was craving a tuna melt, so i took a chance (even though I'm disappointed about 80% of the time i go there or to the Oakland location). I ordered a tuna melt (\"do you want that toasted?\") and potato latkes to go, and then waited for 15 minutes for my food even though the place was completely empty and i think there were 3 staff members there. When they brought my food out the staff member asked me if I'd wanted latkes, and told me he hadn't made them or charged me for them. I said no and left, noticing how small the bag was. When i checked out my food i saw this $9 tuna melt was the size of a standard sandwich you'd make with grocery store sliced bread, and was literally just cheddar on tuna salad. I didn't specify that i wanted stuff on it (lettuce, tomatoes, mayo) so okay I guess that's on me. I hopped on the bus to go eat my lunch in a nice shady spot in Oakland, and quickly noticed that the bag was leaking some mysterious green juice that got onto my clothes and backpack.\n\nIn the end i have only myself to blame-- i know better than to mess with this place.\n"}, {"author": "Chris H.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2017-09-27", "description": "The thing I love most about the Bagel Factory isn't even their bagels: it's their breakfast entrees.

Its empty, large, dusty, unkempt, out of date (less important). I wanted to enjoy my breakfast while I did school work, but I couldn't because their internet was broken. The customer service was meh. The bagel sandwich with lox and a cup of coffee was over 10 dollars. What disturbed me most was how incredibly dim the place was. The workers were literally in the dark! Also, above them was a terribly dusty ceiling tile frame. Right above where I assume some of the food was made. Yuck! This place has been around for a LONG time. I hope they eventually decide to invest in some updates and bring it up to snuff. It would definitely attract more business that way. This place is a Gordon Ramsey level fixer-upper.

Buying my bagels freshly-made from the Bagel Factory instead of in a plastic bag from the grocery store.\n\nI like the Squirrel Hill location because it's convenient to my house, and although there is metered street parking in the front, there is also a (pay) parking lot behind the building if you have to go during a busy time of day. \n\nThey have a ton of different house-made cream cheeses (the lox and chive ones are my favorites, although they have a variety of plain and sweet-flavored cream cheeses as well). The bagels are stored behind a glass partition so you can see which of their dozen-plus flavors are available when you go in. I'm partial to the cracked wheat and grain bagels, but there are blueberry, garlic, honey oat, plain, and everything bagels (to name just a few). All of them are super-fresh and filling but light.\n\nAnd best of all - at the Squirrel Hill location, if you go on a Tuesday to pick up your bagels, buy six bagels and get six bagels for free!! Free bagels! You can't argue with that! \n\nThe staff is always really friendly and helpful. They helped me learn how to freeze bagels without sacrificing quality (so that I could take advantage of that six-free-bagels deal). And any time there's a sale or a special, they will tell you right away when you go in.\n\nThe only negative part of my whole Bagel Factory experience is that the stairs leading from the shop to the parking lot out back are metal, and no matter what shoes I am wearing, I sound like an elephant entering and exiting the building. Sorry, Bagel Factory employees! I wish I didn't sound like a stompasaurus every time I go in!\n\nThis shop also has a huge chalkboard menu of sandwiches (although I have  only gone for bagels, so I can't comment on the sandwiches), and they sell fresh bread loaves, cookies, and other baked goods as well.\n\nSo, be ready to say goodbye to Thomas' bagels at Giant Eagle.

Overall, I'd go back, but I wouldn't pick it.   \n\nThe good...\n- The rooftop area is good on a nice day.  They have a shade sail and it's a relaxing space.  One walk up window for drinks and a limited food menu up there.   \n- The service overall was good.  The rooftop lost my tab, but when I asked if I could just take care of it downstairs with my dinner tab, she said yes.  Nice and easy.  I reminded the downstairs service at the beginning and end of the meal, but it never appeared on my bill.  She finally came around and just said it was on the house.  No problem there!   \n- The decor.  The industrial theme is well done and the place has a nice feel to it.   \n\nThe eh...\n- The food.  This was the main reason that it got downgraded.   The Korean wings were syrupy sweet - way too sweet.  Nice spice level, but so sweet.  Same with the salad I ordered.  It was huge and had a ton of toppings, which I loved; but again, it was very sweet.  \n- The menu.  I had looked on Eliza's website and picked out what I wanted to order, but the new menu didn't have either of those things.  If you are gonna put it out there, make sure it's right.   \n- Signage.  Am I allowed to park in the lot?  No idea.  Is this unmarked side door what I'm supposed to use for the restaurant?  No idea.  Rooftop bar?  Total guess.   Improvement needed there for sure.\n"}, {"author": "Arlene M.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2018-06-26", "description": "Today is the official opening day of Eliza's Bistro's and I was glad to visit it. The bistro is under different management than the Hotel Indigo which houses it but it carries the same industrial motif and color scheme as the hotel itself. Since this place was built on the former site of a J and L Steel mill the bistro decided to also recreate the authenticity of what once stood here. I was literally blown away by the paintings and the designer who I had met over at the hotel told me that they were planning on putting in a large full wall painting over in the corner. Even the ceiling made you feel like you were in a blast furnace. They also have free WiFi here. I also learned that in the near future they will be having weekend brunch.\n\nI had a very friendly and helpful waitress. I sat in a booth away from the bar and high top area so I could take in the surroundings. Outdoor seating is available if you choose. I learned the place was named for a granddaughter of the J and L Steel Mill whose name was Eliza. I also learned that Steel mills used to carry names associated with their blast furnaces.\n\nMost everything with the except the salmon is local sourced. The salmon comes from Ohio. I wanted to try the Brussels Sprouts so my waitress substituted that with my fried chicken sandwich as my side. Normally you get a side of French Fries or small salad with dressing.\n\nI got my food fairly quickly. The sandwich was topped with coleslaw and had cheese on the bottom. The sandwich was moist and tender. I found the Brussels Sprouts a little on the dry side but my waitress explained to me that they are fire grilled. That made me happy because I love Brussels sprouts and was able to enjoy them better.\n\nI'm glad they made that substitution because I wanted to try one of their desserts. Today they were offering standard flavors of Millie's ice cream or homemade cheesecake topped with cherries. I opted for the latter since I'm well acquainted with Millie's and can attest that they have good ice cream.\n\nMy cheesecake was not overly large which I was glad about but moist and delicious! I can see this place becoming very popular with the locals once word is out. There is a free lot outside the complex before you enter. Next to it stands a pay parking garage. There is no public transportation and I'm not sure if the shuttle I learned about in the hotel would cater to restaurant patrons. Since they are in a hotel they are open every day of the year which makes it a bonus if you would rather eat out during the holidays.\n\nEliza's bistro sits in the Hotel Indigo which is in the middle of Technology Dr that runs parallel to 2nd Ave. The only real drawback I can see is having to deal with rush hour traffic. Other than that it is well worth a visit. Good food at reasonable prices. You can't ask for more.\n"}, {"author": "Deborah L.", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2019-04-04", "description": "*this review is of the cafe/bar, not the seated dining & food\n\nAs a student at bridgeside point, there aren't many options for food/coffee in this area so I was hoping this would be a good option for those days I need an extra boost of caffeine between classes. However, I went with 3 of my classmates one afternoon and we were greatly disappointed. We all ordered vanilla lattes but there was no consistency between our drinks. The espresso tasted burnt, some drinks had extra milk and that's all you could taste, but one was only filled 1/2 as much as the rest of ours. The worst part about all of this was we ended up paying ~$6 + tip for a 12oz cup of coffee? I'm not sure what the actual size was, but I do know for sure that it was not worth it.

Then I learn later that half of my party parked in the hotel lot - for free.  \n\nThere was only one other party seated other than our group of five so the service was rather quick.  None of ordered a brunch cocktail so it was just coffees and teas, but I did see that someone from the other group had a nice looking Bloody Mary.\n\nI ordered the smoked salmon on a bagel with a side salad.  The salad was fine but the entree was impossible to eat without looking like a mad Viking.  First, you couldn't even cut through the bagel and it was just as hard to bite into.  My friend and I both had this option and we each had to deconstruct and pick apart to eat.  So that was messy and not fun.  But the salmon was good and the egg was seasoned nicely.  \n\nThe prices were reasonable.  It just isn't quite a happening place on a Sunday morning/afternoon.

We had family in from out of town and I thought it would be nice to check out Eliza- as I've been meaning to check it out for a while. We arrived on time for our reservation and were quickly informed that the service would probably take a while, as a large wedding party had arrived and would also be getting served brunch. I am a patient person and we decided to hang out for a bit. 20 minutes went by and no server had come over to see us, we weren't all given menus, and no one had offered us drinks. We watched other tables receive service during this time. I understand they were short-staffed, but it really felt like we just weren't valued at all. I decided to make the decision to leave before we ordered anything, as I figured this would have been a disastrous experience had we stayed. I suggest that the management pay a little more attention in the staffing- it was a holiday weekend, and they should have expected the customer volume to be higher than normal. It was embarrassing to take out-of-towners to a new cool restaurant, just to have to rush to find another place that's not on an insane brunch wait. Luckily, I was able to find a spot in Southside to accommodate us. I hate to give a place a bad review when I haven't even tried their food, but I just was really disappointed that management didn't plan ahead here. \n\nAlso, you can apparently park in the hotel lot to dine here.

The restaurant was about 15% full so lots of places to choose from. We chose one of the unfortunately awkward booths (long table so if you want to face each other you are far away) because the chairs at the tables looked more trendy than comfy.\n\nNice and quiet. Perused the drinks menu and almost choked at the wine prices - they are literally charging $19 for a glass of a Sauv Blanc that doesn't even cost that much PER BOTTLE at the PLCB store. Server came for our drink orders and then vanished for 20 minutes. Given how empty and quiet the place was, it was a mystery as to why it took so long. Drinks were ridiculous. My gin cocktail was almost certainly a virgin drink (tasted of nothing but citrus and simple syrup) and my husband's bourbon cocktail was one inch of drink (before you removed the giant ice cube). He then ordered a martini figuring that would at least be a real drunk and that arrived as one-third full of a small coupe. All three drinks totaled $50. COME ON.\n\nThe food was fine, not enough to make up for the rest of the oddness: the lamb meatballs were actually pretty good but they were oddly shaped, some were round and others were just pieces of meatballs: so much for presentation. My husband got the cavatelli and the pesto had broken which led to the pasta sitting in a pool of green oil. I got the Po Boy, which was impossible to eat as served because the clams were chewy and large and would just pull out of the sandwich when bitten into.\n\nMy husband's plate was cleared, I was about halfway through deconstructing my sandwich so I could eat the clams, and our server came over and asked if we were ready for our check. Um, what? Not asking if we wanted coffee or dessert was really odd to us, but by that point we were one of only three parties remaining in the restaurant (it was 8:30) and we thought maybe she really just wanted to leave.

The patio was nice with elevated (stool) seating, which may be a deal breaker for some, but the patio is not near the main road so not a ton of cars going by, a plus. \n\nThe waitress came to our table quickly to get our drink orders and I asked for the happy hour menu [I could not find it ANYWHERE prior to my visit so I added a pic to the Yelp posting, you're welcome :)]. Though the menu is quite small, especially with foods, the foods really are a great deal. An especially good value are the pizzas (choice of margherita or pepperoni), because they are a nice size (8 cut!) and very delicious, you will probably have leftovers as I did. My friend said that the seafood tacos were very good, and they did look very nice on the plate. Their greenhouse salad is also delicious and a good portion, and they have their own spin on it- there's raisins and salted sunflower seeds sprinkled on top. Normally I would be reluctant for these in a salad, but it just works! Their salad dressings are all homemade but the dressing cups are extremely small so I had to ask for another.\n\nAll in all, decent food, our service was great, food came within a reasonable period of time. Happy hour is the only time I can see myself coming here in the future because the food is worth the price you pay during happy hour.

Service is good, staff is friendly, but the food is mediocre at best. \n\nOur most recent visit to Rock Bottom brewery was on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was not very busy. We were seated immediately and waited on immediately. \n\nMy husband ordered a $4 flight of drinks on special. He enjoyed each one, especially the Wintercrush, which was suggested by the server. I really liked the Irish Pearl, which is a dark dry Irish stout. It had notes of smoke, wood, and coffee, which I really enjoyed. \n\nFor my meal I ordered the ribeye, medium. It was cooked slightly medium-well around the edges of the steak. There was very basic seasoning on it, so it was just a steak. Nothing special, no seasoning that stood out. I added shrimp to my steak for $3.99. The shrimp were a severe disappointment. They were extra small shrimp, and they lacked any seasoning. They were also overcooked, so they were curled up into tight little balls. \n\nAs for my sides I ordered the green beans (seasonal vegetable), and the apple coleslaw. The green beans were also bland. No seasoning on them at all. They could have used a little garlic or onion or something. The Apple slaw was average as well - it was a standard mayo based slaw, with a few pieces of Apple here and there. I feel like more vinegar would have brightened it up and allowed the Apple to come through more in the dish. If I had to give this meal a letter grade, I would give it a C. \n\nMy husband ordered the fish and chips, with a side of Apple slaw. The fish was tasty, moist and cooked well. The Cajun remoulade was really good, and added a nice touch to the meal. The fries (chips) were standard fries seasoned with a Cajun season salt. I'd say his meal was better because it was better seasoned. \n\nAll in all we had a good experience, but the food wasn't anything to get excited over. I would probably return for the pub-food and drink specials, but wouldn't come back if I were in the mood for steak.\n"}, {"author": "Chad B.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2016-01-10", "description": "Was only here for drinks so this is not a reflection on food.

Perhaps it is the abundance of Chinese restaurants that we have. Or, the fact that I really do not like those grab and go take out Chinese joints. But, a week ago I decided to give it a try and guess what? I'm back again. The former Kentucky fried chicken restaurant has been converted. There are tables and they offer table service. Although I did not dine in.\n\nThere were two people there both times I went, a man and a woman. Both are extremely pleasant, the woman smiles when she talks to you. She makes you feel warm and welcome. And you can see that they are working hard in the kitchen making the food from scratch. Not the premade foods that you find in many quick fix Chinese.\n\nThe main reason I went back is because of the dumplings. There is a certain dumpling that I absolutely love. That you cannot find anywhere but on some buffets. They are not your typical dumpling. You know, the ones that are crescent moon shaped and an inch or so thick, the dough is heavy, and the meat inside is a giant clump. While tasty, they aren't my thing. But! Asian caf\u00e9 has the dumplings I love. They're different. They're flat. There are about 2 inches long and the dough is paper thin and melts in your mouth. As long as they don't change just dumpling recipe I will keep on going back.\n\nI'm a creature of habit. When I find something I like I stick with it. Rarely do I vary off the normal path of my ordering or I get disappointed. The last time I was there I had mei fun noodles, this time I opted for the shrimp lo mein. Needless to say I was not disappointed. I was very happy with my choice. The shrimp was tender, and the noodles dance with flavor. They weren't dry like most places, the noodles and sauce were moist. I have to try the eggroll next time. And perhaps the soup. I didn't do so today because I didn't want to crush my appetite on those dumplings. That was the main reason I went.\n\nAsian caf\u00e9 is a winner! I plan on visiting this place often. Especially since my favorite restaurant Chinese restaurant has now closed down.

The bread wasn't toasted, like it traditionally is, and not nearly enough cheese and thousand island dressing on it. I took one bite and put it to the side immediately. I got a roasted red pepper beef steak sandwich, which was okay. I put some Arby's sauce on it to try and see if that would make it better but it didn't. I just didn't care for it. The cheese they chose to melt on the sandwich was odd, it was more like a qu\u00e8so cheese than provolone as stated on their menu. I also got a buttermilk fried chicken sandwich, and that was the best sandwich out of what I ordered. It came with lettuce, tomato and garlic aioli, but could have used way more aioli, didn't have that much on the sandwich. My boyfriend got a classic beef and cheddar sandwich and it was pretty good, but only with the Arby's sauce on it. He also got their Italian sandwich and said it was surprisingly good. If it's one thing I absolutely loved from Arby's it's hands down their sides. I could sit there and eat those jalape\u00f1o poppers with that berry sauce for days. They were amazing! The mozzarella sticks were to die for as well, along with their curly fries too. I wouldn't mind going back to try a few more things before I officially never go back to Arby's again, but then again their sides had me in heaven.

After I ordered, my phone began ringing, I couldn't answer due to work, they 4 times back to back to back! If I'm not answering there is a reason, leave a message! The reason they were calling was that they were out of white meat.. ok... except they still charged me the price... when it arrived my bag was full of grease, maybe from the butter in the Alfredo, and water? Nice presentation guys, the water I'm assuming came from the steamed veggies and not so stir fried, fried rice.. there is now way any of that was stir fried. Mushy veggies, no signs of any stir frying, saut\u00e9ing.. the dark meat chicken on the Alfredo was mostly bone.  The flavor of the jerk chicken combined with whatever recipe they use for Alfredo does not go well together at all. 30 dollar, literally in the trash.

First, they had only two options available to eat from their entire menu- jerk chicken and pepper steak. I was bummed out by this because I really wanted to try something different- perhaps the oxtail. I ended up getting the jerk chicken, which was good. The chicken had quite a bit of bones in it, but the sauce was outstanding!! It had the perfect amount of sweetness and spice. It complimented the chicken very well and added some flavor to the otherwise boring and bland white rice and cabbage. For dessert, I got a piece of cake from their refrigerated dessert selection- it's all cakes and cheesecakes that are homemade. The cake was decadent and probably the best thing that I had at Pauline's. The cake was moist and the icing on it was amazing. \n\nIn the future, I would like to give Pauline's a second chance. Maybe they have more options on their menu during the week rather than a snowy, cold weekend. The prices are reasonable and the food is prepared quickly, so you don't have to wait super long for your food.

This was once the location of Verde/ Prairie. The Primanti's staff did a great job as this location looks nothing like it did previously and really feels like a Primanti Bros. now. Every bit of useable space has been used to add as many seats and tables as possible. There are also lots of big screens everywhere to help cheer on the Bucs, Pens and Steelers.\n\nOn our pass we were given a specific time to arrive which was 6pm. Once we arrived our party of four could barely fit inside as there were quite a few people ahead of us waiting to be seated. About 15 minutes later the hostess asked for our name our party size and told us that the wait would be about 20 minutes. Some people who arrived after us were seated before us because the hostess had asked them for their names before making her way to us which made our wait even longer. \n\nBy now we had been standing around for 45 minutes and still weren't seated. The reason the wait was so long was that people were finished eating and were just hanging out instead of getting up so people who were waiting could be seated. We were offered something to drink while we waited which was a nice touch.\n\nFinally we were seated Alexander our server came to tell us about the food and take our drinks orders. The music was way too loud as we could hardly hear Alexander speak and had to repeat to each other what he had said. He was very green and should have had a seasoned server to show him the ropes first. We had to ask him to refill our daughters glass as it was empty for qit a while.\n\nThe adults at the table started off with the Drunk Duck cocktail which was amazing and helped me to quickly forget how pissed off I was with the long wait. Next we chose a bucket of the Spicy Garlic wings which were amazing once we finally got to eat them as we had to flag down another server to get some plates.

Say no more!\n\nThe restaurant is long and narrow inside and there is a bar which you can sit at and watch the cooks produce their goods, and goods they are. We had to wait a few minutes for a seat to open and we sat ourselves promptly. Our server took our order for beverages while we checked out the menu. I had coffee as did she. Their coffee is a bit on the weak side, so if you're expecting a pick me up, look elsewhere. It's diner coffee.\n\nI chose to have two eggs over medium, home fries, sausage patties(one of each, hot and sweet) and Italian toast. The toast was easily 1-1/2\" thick. Evidently the sausage is made specifically for Gab & Eat from what I gather. It's good. In fact it's probably some of the best breakfast sausage I'd ever ate in a restaurant. The seasoning was perfect. My eggs were a hair underdone for over medium, but they were still very good. The home-fries were both soft and crispy at the same time. They were fantastic. \n\nI also ordered two pancakes. Being as I'd never been I figured I'd better try them, you know, for science sake. They were good. Nice and fluffy, good flavor and not burnt. Definitely should've just ordered one.\n\nShe had the 1/2 Mixed Grill add mushrooms and half of a Belgian waffle. She loved it.

If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.\n\nI easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can't imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.

There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I'd barely started.  The sausage was great, just don't ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   \n\nIn case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.

She came back to our table with a revised bill, apologized, then went back to her station to chat it up with her cohorts.\n\nThere are plenty of options and places to eat and think we'll skip the Red Ring.

I wasn't sure what to expect walking in but this place was setup pretty nice and looks to be a bit higher class than I thought it would be being this close to campus. They had a lot of good lunch options including burgers, sandwiches and salads. Most come with an option of fries or homemade chips which I highly recommend. The chips come with a great French onion dip.\n\nWe ordered the Nachos and Soft Pretzels as appetizers and these both came out quickly. Both were excellent! The Pretzels were well made and super soft with a good cheese sauce while the Nachos came with chicken, baked on cheese along with fresh veggies including fresh chunks of avocado and raw jalape\u00f1o.  There was plenty to share and a table of five didn't finish them all.  For my entree I went with the Cheesesteak which didn't disappoint!  The horseradish/A1 combo was simply fantastic!  It was a large portion and had to be cut in half to easily eat. I already mentioned the chips/dip but it's worth saying again so make sure to try them.\n\nThe service was fine. Nothing over the top. She seemed friendly enough but didn't really go out of her way even though we were one of two tables at the time.  We did all have a laugh and point out that I was the only one not to receive a refill. I'm also the only one who got water. If you are paying for your drink, I guess it's a one time only deal haha!  \n\nI'd like to come make and check out their dinner and night life. There bar looked pretty stocked and they had a decent amount of TVs for games and such. Curious if they do any music nights or anything.  Definitely check it out when in the area.\n"}, {"author": "Ashley P.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2018-10-25", "description": "We stopped by before the Metallica concert at PPG paints for some drinks and appetizers. It's in the perfect location for the venue, just a block away. Although it was packed, I think we got there late enough where some people were leaving for the show because we got seated right away. They were selling Metallica's \"Enter Night\" pilsner, which was cool, but they sold out really quickly. \n\nWe ordered some nachos, buffalo chicken dip and a couple of drinks. Everything came out really quick, but also tasted that way. The food was \"meh\", really nothing special. Not much flavor. My friend got one of the drink specials with Tuaca and she said it was super sweet.

I used to LOVE this restaurant. It's close to the arena, the service is always very friendly, the food is decent, etc.\n\nTHEN, the female manager started interacting with us and I just haven't liked the place since. The service is still friendly and food is still okay, but the rude manager really makes an impact - especially since she encourages bad seating processes.\n\nOnce, we were going to have a party of 3 and were seated at a table for 6, though the restaurant was mostly empty and there were PLENTY of tables that seated 4 (our friend had to cancel, so we moved to a table of 4 knowing there would be only 2 of us and the table was used for a party of 5 later).\n\nMANY times, we've been there with parties of 4 when they wouldn't seat us at a table for 6, since they think there may be a bigger party coming in later - they'd have tons of people waiting for tables and lots of available tables, but be unwilling to sit parties together (as they do in some busy bars that have poor table layouts) or sit a smaller party at a larger table. They do the same thing when there are 2 people and a bunch of tables that seat 4. We've been seated and gotten through our whole meal while couples waited to be seated, though there were empty tables. Kinda crazy that they would rather LOSE MONEY than seat people.\n\nI've seen other reviews mentioning this female manager, which doesn't surprise me, since she has been rude 100% of the time we've dealt with her and we used to go to the Red Ring a lot more. We've gotten more and more annoyed with the management and tend to choose other restaurants so we don't have to deal with her.\n\nThe mac & cheese is cold 99.99% of the time when you first get it (one time it was warm - I almost passed out from shock). I'm not sure how they prepare it, but whatever they do, it'll sometimes have steam coming off, but it's always cold. Knowing this, I touch a noodle with a finger as soon as I get it and send it back to be warmed up. Usually, this is not an issue. The waiter/waitress or male manager takes it back to be heated, apologizes, etc. A couple times, our food has been delivered by the female manager. On those occasions, she has actually argued with me (though she SAW me touch the noodles with my finger to see if it was warm or not). Even if I had no feeling in that finger and I happened to be incorrect (not the case), I see no reason for a manager to argue with me over my food. We keep hoping he'll move on to another restaurant and give the Red Ring a try again occasionally. I read a review that said they're managed by Aramark, which surprised me, since Aramark tends to be a smart company and it doesn't seem like they'd want a manager who's always rude and chooses empty tables over tables with people at them so often. \n\nI've tried to find out how to contact the district manager (or even store manager if it's not the rude female manager), but I've had no luck. I've asked to speak with the male manager about the issues with the rude manager a couple times, but he's normally been too busy helping out, since we only go there before Penguins games. (I've had a good interaction with him over other issues earlier in our history with the Red Ring and think talking to him might be useful.)\n\nIf you decide to go there, get there well before any event, so you can be seated without issues. If you have any issues, try to get the male manager, since the only female manager we've seen there will NOT care at all and will probably just upset you more. \n\nThe food is still decent and all the wait staff we've ever dealt with has been very friendly. If you don't have to deal with the female manager at all, I think the Red Ring is decent (I'd rate it a 4). If you do, I'd rate it a 1 at best.

This place is definitely different from other pizza shops and I can see how people would like it, but myself and my family are not one of them. I've had square cut pizzas before so this is not some new novelty to me. I've also had other pizzas with the toppings ground/grated instead of sliced. Both methods are fine for my taste, so these specific things making Sir Pizza \"unique\" in the pittsburgh area did not influence my review, although some others might love or hate this aspect.\n\nWe bought a large pepperoni and large white pizzas. Here's my specific breakdown of both:\n\nPepperoni:\nThe crust: It is not a \"thin\" crust, like a cracker or something similar from pizza hut or papa johns. It is a regular thickness, but has cheese and toppings to near the edge and is square cut, meaning there is no huge breadstick like crust on the end to hang onto. I like the to the edge topping, and I did not think it was freezer burnt or tough. It was light but crispy. Overall it was average. My wife however said it was terrible. If this crust was cut like a normal pizza into \"pie\" sections, I don't think people would think too much about it, but since it's square cut it gets a lot of attention.\n\nToppings: the pepperoni being grated/ground into small pieces was fine. Their website claims it is to distribute the flavor evenly. I've had this type of topping before and I have liked it in the past, but the pepperoni was a little bland. Overall, like the crust, average.\n\nThe sauce: This is where the pizza really took a hit. Some other reviews describe it as sweet, i agree with other reviewers that it is just bland. There is not flavor there. It was pretty bad. Add some spices guys.\n\nCheese: I like provolone on my pizza instead of mozzarella, which Sirs Pizza has. It's a higher quality and more expensive cheese. There's a reason the crappy $4 pizza at the super market has a big \"100% mozzarella\" label on it, because mozzarella is a cheap cheese. So I'm glad they use a better ingredient, they just put barely any on the pizza. To say the cheese is sparse is being kind.\n\nWhite:\nThe white pizza had the same crust and cheese as the pepperoni, so you either like it on both or you don't. where the white fell short again was in the sauce. I like my white to have a strong garlic taste, this was again bland. The tomato topping drown out the garlic flavor making it taste more like a bruschetta without only diced tomatoes and olive oil without any seasoning. Again average at best.\n\nMy wife said it was the worst pizzas she has ever had, saying she preferred Digorno, which I think is definitely over dramatic, but still, she hated it. I thought it was average, which made what I hated, THE PRICE, even worse. Two 14\" pizzas with 1 topping for $28. That should be gourmet, not meh. \n\nSo the wife hated it, the kids didn't like it but didn't hate it. I thought it was on par quality with a little caesars, which I can get for $5 each, not $12, so hard pass in the future. 3* for me, 1* for the wife equals 2* overall. \n\nIf you like toppings to the edge of your pizza, or square cut, or ground meats instead of sliced, you may like this place, but there is severe lack of overall flavor and the price doesn't make it nearly enough of a deal to overlook that. Look elsewhere.\n\nI'm also from Pittsburgh so I'm not a NY pizza fascist that will never like anything from here ;)\n"}, {"author": "Nick S.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2018-03-06", "description": "This isn't your ordinary Pizza Place.

The only other time we have been here was when Mrs. Claus comes to the restaurant for the Brentwood Christmas festivities.\n\nThe service here is just great - very attentive and friendly. I don't have a thing bad to say - we didn't have to ask for anything, he brought us everything we needed. I just wish we came sooner. The breakfast that my son got was the funfetti pancakes with sausage patties ($3.99). I had the 2 egg combo with sausage patties, fried potatoes, and toast ($6.99). My son had a large glass of orange juice which was pretty big compared to other diners - I was surprised. The coffee was delicious as I tend to judge breakfast places based on their coffee and breakfast meats. The meals were made just right (and came out at the appropriate time maybe only 15 minutes after we ordered) with the perfect portions that leave you satisfied and not overstuffed.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant gives off a comfortable feel as if you are in your own dining room. There are a few tables to sit outside (and even water dishes for dogs!) - really cute home-y decor. I like the small tabletop trash cans for little trash items from sugar, milk, jelly etc - makes for a smooth cleanup for the staff.\n\nAll of their prices were very reasonable. We often frequent First Watch but this restaurant is probably the nicest little diner in our community and I look forward to many more visits as I prefer to support locally. We really enjoyed our breakfast and even my 7 year old said - \"this place is really cool.\"\n"}, {"author": "Jackie A.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2019-11-01", "description": "Service: 4\nFood: solid 3.\nWe were a little disappointed in our visit here today.

More than one thing on the plate just looked like something frozen or generic I could buy in the freezer isle.

While bottomless mimosas are really my thing, places like this still get the job done even when I can't live my limitless mimosa dream. The area where Crack'd Egg is located is super cute and quaint. The street in Brentwood has a small town, old-fashioned vibe with hints of modern culture with the GameStop across the street. \n\nWe went on a Sunday late morning, and the wait time was approximately 20 minutes for two. There was a bit of line. When you walk in, the space is much larger than it appears from the outside. We were seated just under 20 minutes in the middle of the dining room. The noise level is quite moderate. Be careful of the floor, I almost slipped twice wearing my booties. The decor and atmosphere carries a comfy and homey vibe which is refreshing especially on a Sunday morning. \n\nI ordered the Spiced Pumpkin Coffee off their seasonal menu; the homemade cream was excellent! I savored it for the entirety of my meal. The menu is unique with the names of meals. For example, I ordered the Olive Oyl which is simply a tomato, spinach, mozzarella and olive omelette. It was good and made traditionally. My partner ordered the Steak and Eggs which he admitted needed A1 sauce. He still enjoyed it even though the flavor was slightly lacking. \n\nOverall, we found the food delicious even if needed a little more flavor. The staff was busy but very hospitable and helpful. The space and location are charming.

I tried this place because I read great reviews... well that must all be friends and family afraid to tell the truth. I can never in a million years understand what the buzz is about this cheap knock off of a first watch (which we have back where I am from). The servers look stressed out, yelling going on in the kitchen, the servers had more question about the menu than I did, the cook clearly can't cook an over easy egg. $9 for pancakes? Bacon over cooked and brittle, home fries had so much season salt/msg that they need a defibrillator on hand for heart attacks. Either they use fake egg or they don't know how to make scrambled eggs, so dry. Eggs should be moist and fluffy, not brown/green and sit in the window to let stand and taste like sand. Canned corn beef hash. And my friend ordered the \"fresh\" burger, which was freezer burnt. So what am I paying for? Nothing in there is fresh, so is it hoarding decorations or napkins I am paying for? I can see the burgers being bland at a breakfast place, but if you can't get the fundamentals down on breakfast maybe you shouldn't open a breakfast place up.  If you advertise fresh, don't have bread the only fresh item on the menu, which was the best part of the meal. They use a local bakery but they don't do them justice. \n\n\nP.s. to wait 30 minutes on a Sunday just to sit down and get this, your better off going to fast food chain buy breakfast and throw it out the window, ya'll will be more satisfied.

The exterior is absolutely stunning. The interior is equally impressive. \n\nThe restaurant is hyper-local and doesn't even provide lemons with water. Something I was a little appalled by but later after some thought, admired. \n\nI could tell that the restaurant was still trying to find its groove though. There was only one server in the restaurant who catered to all the guests. Service was a little slow because of this. For a 6 course meal, my two friends and I were at the restaurant for 3.5 hours and left.. still hungry. \n\nI appreciate all the small touches the chef included in the meal such as a welcoming cocktail which was a very tasty, delicate cider. The first dish was roasted sunchokes, topped with fancy salt and black truffle. The sunchokes were cooked to perfection with a very buttery taste and texture. The salt complimented the dish wonderfully. This dish was very unique with exquisite taste however, simple. \n\nNext was a fancy clam chowder. It was great! The clams were very plump and juicy. The soup itself was very buttery. The dish was delicious but nothing out of the ordinary. The third course was a soup with gooseberries, chives, grains and carrots from the chef's garden. This might have been the best dish I had. The dish had different textures that were great and delicious. I was super happy eating this because I also felt healthy. Every bite was a treat. The gooseberries' sweetness mixed with the buttery salty goodness of the broth and oats. This was the best dish; this was the only exceptional dish to me.. all the others were good. \n\nThe last savory dish was venison loin with honey poached cranberries. This dish was tasty and the meat was cooked perfectly, it was super juicy and blended well with the sauce. The meat was salty but blended well with the sweet tartness of the sauce. \n\nThe dessert was apples with cultured cream and blueberry jam. This was super tasty, but just a fancy yogurt. \nThe last course was a little taste of honey. I was a little shocked that a spoonful of honey would be considered a course. The meal concluded with a cute little take home gift of camomile tea and a stick of the featured honey. \n\nWould I come here again? Absolutely after some time. I'd like to give this restaurant a little more time to operate and find its bearings before I return. The food was delicious and executed beautifully. However, the service and portions were slightly off for me. My friends and I decided to go to another restaurant afterwards to order a few appetizers and desserts to feel satisfied.\n"}, {"author": "Carol W.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-09-23", "description": "My husband and I enjoyed a multi course meal here.

They've got some amazing dishes and the chef uses techniques which are most definitely fine dining certified, pretty sure you're not going to get any better as far as ingredients. We were lucky enough to get a spot at the chef's table and got the VIP chefs grand tasting experience. Of course it's the expensive thing on the menu at $139 (keep in mind there are other options with 4 courses starting at $65, 8 courses at $95, do the math). For the finesse that you're getting on the plate. You won't find it anywhere else in Pittsburgh. Probably closer to a $250-a-plate meal in Manhattan. \n\n\nAll the ingredients are locally sourced as much as possible, vegetarian options are there. Staff is friendly and the decor puts you in a vibe which definitely elevates your meal. Don't sleep on it, the ingredients and dishes obviously change with the SEASONS, we had some incredible dishes for December! Think truffles (white and black), lobster, mushrooms, winter vegetables, venison... can't think of the rest. The complexity and variety of ingredients will definitely send your culinary prowess into overdrive. Pittsburgh's restaurant scene is transforming, and Seasons on the wave. Chef David will bring you places.\n\nDONT F*CKIN SLEEP. If you've got a hankering to bring your loved one and enjoy some really fine food, Take their asses here and put a stop to just swallowing generic midwestern fare. \n\nThese photos are some, not all, but you'll get the picture.

The place is very small and reservations are required. Dress is casual and it is BYOB for wine pairings.\n\nChef David B, whom I had the pleasure of speaking with explained to me that everything is local sourced, there are seasonal adjustments to the menu and they go even to get their salt from mines in WV as well as use special olive oil. The decor is unique ranging from a metal moose head to a wall \"cork board\" where they will nail your wine cork into the board as each patron opens their bottle.\n\nThe menu changes on a daily basis but you are not given a physical menu to look at. Instead your waitress will ask you a series of questions related to any food allergies you have and how you prefer your food. This is primarily a tasting menu so you can choose anywhere for 4-8 courses, They have a regular chef's menu as well as a vegetarian menu in which to choose from. Gluten free and vegan can be made upon request.\n\nI decided to go with the 4 course tasting menu. (quick note-the 4 course tasting menu is only available on Thurs, other days you would have to choose between the 6 or 8 course.)  As a prelude I was given something called a one bite potato pierogie with chives and sour cream. This tiny dish was outstanding!  Everything is prepared slowly and your utensils are constantly changed so you can savor the taste. For my 1st course I had a beet tart with sour cream. The shell was made at Buckwheat farms (may not have spelled it right). Needless to say this was one of the best beet dishes I ever had! My 2nd course was a wild mushroom bisque that consisted of roasted mushrooms, with roasted potatoes, chicken, and greens from their garden. This too was exceptional. My 3rd course was butternut squash risotto made with duck herbs and local Parmesan. Instead of rice Chef David grinds the squash into a texture that resembles risotto. This item too was one of the best squash risottos I ever tasted.\n\nAs I was waiting for my next course I learned that the Chef was preparing a 5th plate for everyone in house this evening. Meantime upon request they made me from scratch a glass of ice tea which comes from Tupelo honey tea over in Milvale. This special plate turned out to be roasted sirloin from grass fed beef, red peppers, and roasted eggplant. Believe me this plate was a meal in itself. The final course was dessert. The uniquely created dessert was a poached apple covered by cookie crumbles from Winterberry Farms along with goat cheese and honey in an apple cider base. Needless to say this is a rather different approach to dessert since the goat cheese takes away some of the sweetness of the apple and gives it a somewhat sour taste.\n\nConsidering the great effort used in not only acquiring the best local sourced ingredients (shown on their website) and the amount of work taken into preparing each individual plate the meal is expected to be expensive. However, I never have an issue with that when it comes to quality and hard work. The staff was very attentive to my needs and made sure I had everything I needed to enjoy this wonderful tasting menu.\n\nSeasons is open for dinner only on Thurs-Sat from 6:00-9:30 pm. Metered street parking is available in Etna but there is no charge due to the lateness of the day. Seasons is not just a restaurant but a dining room  experience. This restaurant is a welcome addition to the Etna community.\n"}, {"author": "K K.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-10-24", "description": "Incredible tastes, textures, and service!  Superb fois gras.

I love that all of the ingredients are locally sourced and that gratuity is included in the price, which makes me believe the staff are earning a living wage. Yes, at $114 to $165 per person, this is going to be one of the more expensive restaurants in Pittsburgh - but it's worth it because of the quality of food, the innovative menu that always changes and the intimate experience of having a quiet restaurant that only takes reservations and holds no more than 14 people . Plus, the chef would personally come out and explain the meals to us and where the ingredients came from.

Fine dining of this caliber is usually paired with a little pretense. Be honest, even if you're into the scene, you know this is true. It's just part of the gig.\n\nThat, for me, is where Seasons really shined. There was no pretense. The night I was there, service was provided by a single person, and she was super nice, conversational and had a great sense of humor. \n\nThe Chef stopped by, said hello and introduced himself. He then returned to our table all night long to talk about each dish, where he got the ingredients, what he was thinking about when he was putting it together, etc. \n\nThis felt personal, informal and actually kind of humble.

They apparently were a little understaffed as someone had called off. The restaurant space itself is nice. It is a BYOB so plan accordingly. Each member of my party had the standard tasting at $88 a person (hospitality included). Some of the courses left a bit to be desired. I cannot recall what was in the soup but it was served in a cup the size of a large shot glass. One of the courses was an egg and truffle dish, eating eggs for dinner seemed a little odd but they were very good. This was followed by duck (served two ways) and then a venison dish. Not a huge venison fan but I really loved it tonight. The portions on both of these varied significantly between different folks at our table. Some of the proteins were not warm enough, not sure if that was intentional. There was an apple and cream dessert and also a taste of honeycomb. I love the idea of this place, serving locally-sourced products but something in the execution seemed a little off. As above, I know they were understaffed but I wasn't really impressed with the service, we were there for 3.5 hours. Perhaps as a product of being there for a few hours and having small portions, I left still a little hungry which wasn't really something I was expecting with all the courses.

The chips were crisp and generously topped with black beans, guacamole, queso - which was delicious - and our protein of choice: brisket.  Now, it takes a LOT for me or my SO to comment that something is salty... but this brisket was borderline inedible. I picked around a good bit of it to find the chips that were slathered in the cheese/bean/guacamole goodness.  I'd definitely order these again, but perhaps with the chicken or taco beef instead.  I appreciated that the protein was included and not a separate upcharge.\n\nNext up were a shared order of four tacos:\n\nGrilled Chicken - this is your basic grilled chicken taco, folks.  No frills, it's topped with a smooth crema, diced tomatoes, cheese, and lettuce.  They definitely skimped on the toppings, as the lettuce, cheese, and tomato almost felt like a garnish rather than a part of the dish.  However, I did quite like the cheddar cheese they use.\n\nChicken Al Pastor - this was probably the most disappointing of the lot.  I remarked during our meal that it looked like it was missing something and that I thought there were more toppings listed on the menu.  Sure enough, we missed out entirely on the avocado and cilantro... and the \"al pastor\" was nothing more than diced pineapple on top of some grilled chicken.  Definitely not worth the $5 price tag.\n\nCrispy Cod - sadly, this crispy cod was not crispy at all and was missing the napa cabbage listed on the menu.  The mango salsa was a nice touch... but if you're going to bill something as being \"crispy,\" it damn well better be crispy. \n\nLoaded Crispy Potato - this taco also contained the aforementioned brisket.  Aside from the salt quotient, this taco was decent and the most plentiful of the bunch.  The iO sauce packed a punch.\n\nI'm sad that this experience wasn't better...

The decor is fun, the place is nice and clean which is a must for any restaurant. The staff all seemed friendly and helpful but then I got my food.... I'm not saying the food is bad because it's not but it's also nothing to tell anyone about either. They need to improve their recipes if they want to make it in Mt Lebanon! The meats they use are dry and bland as well as the rest of their ingredients. Maybe I caught them on a bad day? The entire experience wasn't bad at all but the food was well below expectations for a Mexican food joint with plenty of competition around to require the food to stand out in order to survive.

I actually think their starters are better than the tacos. Their chips and queso are fantastic, the chips especially are very good. The sauce that comes with the patatas bravas is excellent. They have a good selection of tacos. You can buy tacos individually or can buy platters (with rice and beans) of either two or three of the same tacos. One thing I did not like is that when you mix and match tacos, which I'd imagine is what most people do, you have to pay extra for the rice and beans. I did this and wish I hadn't, the rice was fine but the beans tasted like they came out of a can. The carnitas taco was great, the chicken al pastor had no flavor at all. The tacos were pretty small. They ran out of Diet Coke.

I'd love to have a bean taco, but finding one in Pittsburgh is harder than it should be. I bring this up just in case the owners read the reviews.

The lunch menu today seemed so much more limited than what was available in the past, and the prices are higher also.  In the past I remembered getting four tacos for $10, but that deal was not advertised today, and each taco was $5.  Also, of the four kinds offered on the menu, they were out of the brisket, and were substituting ground beef.  I was surprised there was no guacamole at all on the lunch menu, and the many choices of hot sauces they used to have were nowhere in sight.  They also no longer offered glass bottles of Mexican Coke, which was disappointing, but at the same time, it also gave me a chance to try a cocktail, and I had the \"El Diablo,\" which was very tasty, but I felt that the alcohol content was pretty weak.  I had the Carnitas taco, and it was fine, but it wasn't as good as the one I had previously.  I feel like it could've used some pickled onions, or jalape\u00f1os, or something.  After I ate my taco, I was still hungry, so I had the \"Cheesy Tostada,\" and it was good, but nothing too exciting (It was more like a salad than an entree).  Overall my lunch was somewhere between A-O.K. & Yay, I'm a fan, so I rounded up, because the service was fast and friendly.  Would I rush back for lunch?   Hmmmm? . . . probably not, but I might come back again for dinner, as it seems they have a larger menu with a lot more choices in the evening.  Anyways, I still give them a . . . \n. . .

Came with a side of a warm cut up pita bread, warm gyro meat, tomatoes, sliced onions, and cucumber.  The tzatziki sauce was yummy and gave the salad a nice flavor.

We asked for takeout containers and plastic bags for our food, which they obliged.  Nice that we can still get that.\n- Layout.  This place is well laid out and a good space.  There are booths and small tables. \n- Location.  It's in the heart of downtown, which is convenient and walkable. \n- Price.  Most of their dishes are under $10, which is a reasonable price for the amount of food you get.\n- Portions.  Decent size portions for the price you pay.\n\n\nWhat's not\n- They use iceberg lettuce.  You may like iceberg lettuce, but I like dark green lettuce better.  Different strokes for different folks.  Haha... but the salad is still good.\n- Service.  This place is a family owned restaurant.  The day we went was slow, but I was told they're normally quick when the whole family works behind the counter.  My point is to be prepared when they're short staffed, because it really effects their speed.  This place looks popular with the locals, which means you need to be prepared for decent wait times during \"rush hour\".  \n- Layout.  I don't recommend eating in if your group is more than 4 people, because there aren't tables that can accommodate a group larger than 4.

The Butter Chicken was one of the BEST versions of itself that Ive had here in US, almost competing with some great establishments in India as well. The creaminess of the curry, the tartness of the char on the chicken and the moistness of the chicken itself, was simply romance for the taste buds!! The Chicken 65 was perfectly seasoned, not too Spicy, and again cooked just right. The Chicken Biryani had its rice almost harkening back to older times where they imbued the rice with these all spices that made the fragrance elements go off the rails! \n\nWe also tried their Goat, which in itself was Good, but no match for their Chicken dishes.

Sadly, I can't say it succeeds. What these types of joints back in India get right, is consistency. Also, the cook making dosas would focus just on that and the cook handling the Indo-Chinese preparations wouldn't also be in charge of biriyani. That's how they turn around high quality despite the breadth of menu offerings. Without that kind do staffing, it's unsurprising that Caf\u00e9 Delhi doesn't get much right. Not even their masala chai. My spring dosa was missing the 'assortment of veggies', per their menu and was instead just overstuffed with a ton of potato. The paneer is chewy and the chilly paneer arrived sitting in a pool of oil. The naan is just about as good as frozen store bought naan. (Choolaah in Shadyside for me is the gold standard of paneer and naan.) The gobi manchurian is the only item remotely well prepared. Servers are way too busy to make recommendations or even eye contact for that matter. The dishes are simply plonked on the table randomly wherever they find empty space and one's left to figure out which one is whose. I wasn't too happy with cleanliness levels either. \nI've given this place a few tries and I get that Caf\u00e9 Delhi satisfies a certain type of patron.

The tikka masala is great but it seems like they forgot  a key ingredient in theirs which would be black cardamoms and Javentri (Mace) which gives it that flavor.

Remember, the heat in Indian food is mainly due to addition of fresh green chili, red chili powder or flakes, ground black pepper, and sometimes ginger.

We chose our beers first and then reviewed the menu. These transactions take place at two different counters. I ordered the Butter Bean Bread and the roasted cauliflower. Both were excellent, and either could have served as a full meal for me, though admittedly I am a light eater, especially with a filling beer. My husband ordered the smoked meatball hoagie and was similarly pleased. Re beer - well East End has a great selection, and helpful staff. Definitely glad we chose to return, and Larder will join our list of regular places for a casual meal. \n\n(Initial review)  \nMaybe this is unfair because they just opened. We like East End and were excited to try Larder, both because it makes the brewery more of a destination than a stop, and also because Justin Severino is a great chef. I expect some hiccups in the first few days. My husband ordered a Gem Salad and loved it, but at $10 seemed a little pricey for the size and contents of the bowl. I ordered the mussels steamed in Monkey Boy (which I was also drinking) and was disappointed. The dish comes with fries, but the fries were floating along in the bowl of mussels. In other words, soggy. This can be easily fixed by sending the fries in a separate bowl. Or maybe scrap this dish in favor of something more easily assembled. After all, the fries didn't appear to be frites soaked in duck fa offered by Point Brugge, etc (but who can tell when they are part of a \"soup\"?). I expect better execution from Larder in the future, and I'm sure that an update of this review will reflect that. \n\nThe space is nice - definitely and upgrade, and buzzing with people. Worth trying again.\n"}, {"author": "Rachel W.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-09-03", "description": "I am so glad I finally made it here.

Two separate counters to order your food from and then your beers. We tried the mussels, the pulled pork and of course, the chocolate cake. Everything was so flavor-packed but balanced so well. \n\nThis isn't your bar food type experience.

The fries could have been a little less greasy. I think the place is more like a 4.25 but Yelp won't let you rate that. The menu is a bit limited but everything looked and smelled good.

We were there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon (cause we needed the last of the pickle beer) and found a transformed taproom and outside area had been added to East End. The place has a fresh, cool, vibe and the menu is accommodating towards meat eaters, vegetarians, and even children.  \nWe ordered the cucumber-watermelon salad, falafel, and brisket sandwich. All three items were perfectly seasoned and delicious. The watermelon salad came with olives and feta and was refreshing and summery. The falafel came in a great mayo-y based sauce with fresh dill flavors and pickled radishes. The brisket was juicy and melty and I loved the cheese that was on it, ( like a crystally cheddar). I think it could have used a pickled something, but maybe they didn't want to detract from the meat flavor. The beans on the side were AMAAAAZZINNN. Overall, it exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to try next season's menu.\n"}, {"author": "Simone H.", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2019-07-06", "description": "After returning to Pittsburgh after 3 years, I've watched the East Ending Brewing Tap Room grow up. First, it was a brewery watering hole; then they added beer garden; then renovated to become a brewpub with its latest Food installment of Larder. \n\nI was super excited for the brewpub, after moving into the Larimer neighborhood. But Larder was just an all round disappointment. There was a lot of sighing on my end, so it ends up with a two-star review, despite the East End part of this establishment being a 3.5 to 4 star. \n\nSpace: Remodeled and awesome. It has truly grown up. There are tables and booths that are welcoming and comfortable. I do miss the old-school chalkboards that were replaced by the electronic tablet-style board to the right side of the bar -- but so is the future; they added the beer garden a little bit ago and it's truly nice to sit out and enjoy this hot sweltering Pittsburgh heat.\n\nSips: East End continues to represent its hard-earned reputation and produces quality beers -- right on. However, I do feel that prices have increased a dollar or two since 2016 with my last visit there, a strange phenomenon as it outpaces the increase in income in this city.\n\nSnacks: Now here is where I start to get critical. It's a Severino - it's supposed to be good (I would be a disaster if It couldnt produce great food with all the credit Severino has garnered in the past few years). It is in line with his other early establishments mostly reminding me of Tako, just for 'American' street food. So everybody please sit down. I was by myself and ordered two items. The chorizo hotdog with the queso fresca, and Joe's potatoes with the blue cheese and horseradish honey. \n\nFirst the hotdog - yes it tasted good - obviously - when you get a piece of spicy meat that is practically fat and salt on a bun of carbs, OF COURSE your mouth gets Umami feelings. However, no Hotdog should cost $14; I don't care if it's loaded with truffle oil or edible gold (in which case I'd yell at you for using truffle oil and edible gold inappropriately) - a Hot Dog SHOULD stay a street food. Simple, happy, good memory-invoking American Street food -- at $14, Its simply just not worth it. \n\nJoe's potatoes: I want to spit. First: it's four fat potato wedges for $8 - just let that sink in right there. A potato wedge costs $2. It's an item that is ordered in the kitchen for $0.30 a potato. Second: It is roasted with the skin (seasoned) - fine; however, when you cut into the potato, it literally falls apart exposing a very unseasoned potato. The potato itself tastes like one took a raw potato and shoved it in the microwave without dressing it up. Oh - and get this - I picked up the potato bits that stayed on my fork - they GLITTERED -- like wtf? Why is my potato glittery? Is this a twilight potato? Is that why it has no flavor? Next, the horseradish honey -- no horseradish. I kept waiting for the wasabi feeling to hit and be smoothed over with sweetness, but no. None of that. And the blue cheese? Just no. All in all this entire dish was bland beyond compare. \n\nService: ah the service. I feel like they knew this review was coming. \n\nEast end side. To the woman who glided into the bar to get my order - awesome. Thank you for your service. \n\nLarder side - Okay, lets preface that I got to Larder at 4:23 pm (23 minutes after opening time) - they were ready to rock n roll and serve. \n\nThe menus were just being put out (but the little menu stands on the booth tables are too big and couldn't hold the drink special notification), and people were super excited. The Larder employees were crawling around like ants there were so many of them :) (this is not a bad thing - they were very much anticipating a crowd). What I object to is that NOBODY checked on me after they set down my food. But, it didn't stop them from staring me down from behind the bar because I gawked at my glittery potatoes and then pushed them away and didn't touch them. I waited; just waited to see what they would do. Three times the manager on duty went around and gently glided past my table. I had a busboy pick up the empty hotdog carton, wordlessly, but that was it. ... maybe they anticipated a rant? Dunno. When I grabbed my purse and left (as all is prepaid of course at the counter as they make you tip before you see how service is instead of an evaluative event, which it should be; Honestly, counter work such as for food trucks and food stands and carts and pop-ups should just have a no tipping policy because there is no aspect of actual tippable service here; they are just food runners/ food handlers if at a truck, but I digress). I found all the managers socializing and getting their pat on the backs on the ramp of the beer garden - I guess that's where they disappeared to. \n\nAnyways, I will POSSIBLY set foot here again in 3 months after they get their heads screwed on correctly. But until then - nope.\n"}, {"author": "Brant H.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2019-07-09", "description": "Dined at Larder on their opening night (Friday, July 5) and was impressed how smooth everything went, with none of the hiccups we expected.

Despite a sizable crowd, both ordering and service were very quick.  All the staff were super-friendly and attentive.\n\nAlong with solid beers from East End (particularly enjoyed the Allentown, an Imperial Shandy that the server aptly described as Arnold Palmer-esque), we initially ordered the smoked wings with harissa and za'atar, as well as the smoked salmon dip. The six wings were on the small side, but perfectly cooked (crispy and succulent) and the sauce was delicious with just a touch of heat.  The salmon dip was generously portioned, with a nice stack of buttered toast (for once, enough bread!) and some tangy pickled onions and cornichons alongside.  We then ordered the beefsteak tomatoes. The tomatoes themselves were just okay--ripe but less flavorful than I'd hope--but the accompaniments made all the difference:  a sweet tangy chow chow, crunchy sunflower seeds, and smooth, rich avocado spread.  \n\nWe didn't try any of the entrees, but looking forward to coming back to try the brisket!\n"}, {"author": "Liz D.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2019-07-12", "description": "I went here with my boyfriend the other day to see how it was.

We came here and had some beers to start at East End which isn't my favorite brewery but had a few options which really surprised me. The imperial IPA was standout and the kolsch is quite nice too. Back to the food. Given this is Severino we had really high expectations and we're kind of hoping to see some reflection of Cure there. And there was, in a sense. We got the tomato starters which were superb. Then, we split wings (got the harissa rub) and brisket sandwich. The wings were good, but not $8 for six TINY wings good. Frankly I was surprised they source the wings they do. While the harissa resembled the shared chicken dish cure had, I missed out on the smoke flavor and the apricot flavor was MIA. You could have fooled me that the yogurt dip had cumin in it. Maybe the zaatar was too bold, idk. Again, they were good, but nothing id go back for. The brisket sandwich was down right bad. Served on a barely toasted rye, with one slice of brisket. It was $16. So... Yeah.

Plentiful, seasoned, and crisp enough that I devoured them.  But then there was the burger.  It was a frozen patty with no seasoning added.  It was cooked OK and the toppings were fine, but the bun was a bit stale.  Was it better than McDonalds or Burger King?  Absolutely!  But that's a pretty low bar.  For the price I wasn't expecting a fresh ground burger, but how about tossing just a tad of seasoning on it as its cooking so it doesn't taste like a plain old burger.  It was especially surprising given how well the fries were seasoned.\n\nI will likely try it again and maybe get the Beefsteak or other sandwich.  But if I get a stale bun the second time, I'll know its a pattern and not an anomaly\n\nIf you just need something to eat and want it reasonably fast and inexpensive, this is one of the better options in the area.

It is outstanding, satisfying, and worth it.\n\nI looked up the menu prior to arriving and had my decision in mind to hopefully make for a quick stop.  I had gotten the Bacon Burger Combo and my better half decided on the Italian Beef Combo.  With a combo it is basically whatever item on the menu you want with fries and a drink.  Pepsi products are available.  When I placed my order I had a little bit of a wait for it to be ready.  There were already several people inside when I arrived.  Pro-tip here, call ahead to place your order if you are nearby (delivery is available through GrubHub).  \n\nHaving a little time I putzed around a bit.  If you want to dine in, best to come alone, there are only about three seats available at the bar type seating near the windows.  Menu and pictures of menu items are all over the one wall, so if you are not sure what to get this may help.  Staff are extremely friendly, when I first walked in I was greeted happily by one said employee.  Made me feel very welcomed.\n\nFood was finally ready and I head home.  My Bacon Burger was amazing.  Prepared just how I had asked for it.  I had made mine a double which, as an afterthought, was maybe just a little too much for me.  That burger was huge.  Like \"could be the whole meal\" huge.  The burger patty was very flavorful and cooked perfectly.  The fries are hand cut and lightly seasoned.  My better half said that his Italian Beef was pretty close to the real deal.  Being from Chicago originally he was impressed.\n\nDefinitely a place to frequent for me when I get the chance to.

First of all, it's name.  I have no idea who Buford is, but the name itself lends it some of the unique characteristics this place needs. This place is spacious, and can hold a crowd quite comfortably. Its outdoor terrace and proximity to PPG Arena earns it 5 stars, but they are quickly taken away because of the things Buford's doesn't have going for it.\n\nThe menu is not very appealing, food ordered lacked any flavor. Our server didn't seem to understand the concept of waiting on tables, which led to a low tab on his part. Not so sure how soup is any harder to serve over a milkshake, but it became a struggle to get.\n\nTV monitors around the bar area are blocked by low hanging lights, thus causing one to have neck pain by the time the game you are trying to watch is over.  It became annoying to constantly wonder what just occurred on the screen due to your field of vision being blocked.\n\nTake my advice about your visit to Buford's to watch a game, go, but focus on sitting in an area that offers a clear view of the TV, settle on the beverage options, and make sure your server knows how to smile.\n"}, {"author": "Stephanie T.", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2019-04-21", "description": "My family and I went before the Cher concert on Thursday 4-18-19. My 2 aunts got there early to get a table for the 5 of us. They were seated at a table for 6. My mom and I arrived shortly after and walked in, sat down and got waited on quickly. We were waiting for my cousin to arrive. When she arrived they wouldn't let her in due to \"being filled to capacity\". Meanwhile, there were 3 empty tables around us, empty seats at the bar, and 2 empty seats at our table. The hostess began arguing with me and said we can't let her in. I tried to explain that we already were seated and gave her the number of people in our party when we arrived along with the numerous empty seats. She replied with I seated you and wasn't aware of the number. When we told her she didn't seat us she changed her story to her daughter seated us. I asked for the manager and was told he was dealing with an allergy issue. I told her I would wait. She never got the manager or sent him over to our table. My cousin ended up getting in after waiting awhile. This hostess was very rude and had no understanding of parties with multiple guests who were meeting up for a concert after a day of working and arriving at all different times. Along with the fact I've been there for other concerts when it has been packed and had no problem getting in when it was standing room only. On a positive note, food was awesome!

Checked in at the hostess stand and gave them my cell number so they could text me when a table was ready (I like this- who wants to carry a funky transponder around w them) and we were told it would be 20 mins (pretty good since the place was packed).  We found a spot at the bar and ordered 2 beers.  By the time I paid for them I had a text saying the table was ready.  We were seated in the 'map' room towards the back that had walls covered w Pgh area maps.  We were immediately greeted by Mikey who introduced himself and made some menu recommendations.  Being that we were headed to the game we ordered simple things- Pulled Pork Nachos & Chicken and Fries. Our food arrived in about 10 minutes.  The nachos were stuffed in the middle with tons of pork & cheese, salsa & sour cream sprinkled around and BBQ sauce drizzled all over. They were delicious!  See my pic.  Next was the Chicken (tenders) and fries. The fries were only room temp because (as Mikey explained) they're cooked in 'batches' and we must have gotten them towards the old end.  He offered fresh, hot fries but we declined.  He brought them anyway, we LOVED THAT.  The tenders... OH THE TENDERS...!  These were full thick strips of breast meat fried perfectly.  They were the best chicken tenders either of us have ever had!  Mikey comped a draft beer for our 'fry issue' which was very fair.  The place started to clear out and Mikey stopped for a few mins to chat.  He was very friendly and really made us feel appreciated for stopping in.

He usually works overnights so it is rare that we have a day off together. I will say that last Friday was the day that the stars aligned and we were able to enjoy a nice lunch out on the town. We wanted to do something new and something that we haven't tried before. Since we both work and live in the Lawrenceville/Bloomfield area we wanted to go outside of our comfort zone. I was working at Mercy and on my way to Shadyside was just voice texting him restaurants that I was passing on Forbes Ave. Of course he was sleeping and did not get the texts until later but once he did he said that Buford's Kitchen seems nice. I agreed. What is weird is that as an elite Yelper I actually did not read any of their reviews other than to use the app to send him the address. I was astounded to see that after we went their it has such a negative Yelp status. Honestly, that is CRAZY to me. Greg and I had a wonderful time here. The staff was so helpful and nice, the restaurant was super clean, and the food was fantastic. We even ordered drinks and they not only came out quickly when I was asking about a beer Greg ordered the waitress brought over the bar manager to tell me a little bit about it. What great service!!\n\nThe waitress we had took the time to go over her favorites and the best sellers of the restaurant. She was wonderful. And all of our picks were spot on because of her.\n\nAppetizer:\n\nFried Green Tomato with Remoulade Sauce, Scallion Aioli. There were 4 slices of tomatoes on the platter that came out. They were drizzled with the remoulade and aioli and they were delish. I think that the tomatoes could have been a bit of a thicker slice but overall they were filling. I think also for the price there could have been maybe double the amount of tomatoes on the plate. Green tomatoes are not that expensive and with them being so thin, add a few more to the plate!\n\nAndouille Gumbo: This was dang tooting good. I think I could have licked the plate clean and I even mentioned to the waitress to not be shocked if she saw me licking the bowl. The rue that the gumbo was made in was spot on, the sausage tasted amazing, and the who experience was magnificent. I had a cup, should have went with a bowl.\n\nMain Course:\n\nI ordered the Po' Boy for my main food. Because if you are going to try the southern restaurant you better have a heck of a good po' boy. I picked the Oyster po' boy because oysters are one of my favorite foods and fried oysters as just amazing. The po' boy came with lettuce, tomato, mayo, and pickles. I added extra tomatoes and onions to my sandwich because I am difficult and I love tomatoes and onions. I will say that standard the sandwich comes with fries, The waitress said we could sub it out for any of the sides on the menu. Again this is where good service comes in. I asked her how the coleslaw was because I am a bit of a coleslaw snob. I do not like like weird coleslaw or slaw that is made with miracle whip (which is disgusting in my book). She went to the back and got me a little serving dish of the coleslaw for me and Greg to try. That is wonderful service. I hated it so was grateful for her allowing me to try it out. I went with the mixed veggies instead. I will say, I asked what the veggies were and she told me broccoli, carrots, and something else. When it came out it was just zucchini, squash, and onions. Not at all my jam. I ate them and looked longingly at Greg's fries. I would not have picked that as a nice side veggie to eat but since I ate all the fried food, it was ok. I will also say that the veggies were caked in butter. They must be steamed or cooked in a ton of butter. I was a little taken aback by the amount of butter in the bowl, but just kind of went with it. \n\nThe service and the food were wonderful. I would come back any day. I think that it is a nice little lunch spot and the service is excellent.

And as it took us about a half an hour to receive our food, there wasn't time to send it back and ask for something else. I did enjoy the side salad that came with the sandwich. Nice vinaigrette.\n\nOverall, it's a great big \"Ehhhh...\" Next time I need to eat in Oakland, I will choose the Union Grill or one of the Legume restaurants over this place.

This is a nice addition to Oakland as there are not a lot of nicer sit down options around here. The restaurant is on the 10th floor and overlooks all of Oakland. The decor is very trendy. We started with the pain perdu to share. The food did take quite a bit of time to come, so if you are in a hurry be aware of that. The french toast presentation was excellent, but it also tasted delicious. I then had the dutch baby, which was unique as it had a fried egg on top of this pancake souffl\u00e9.

Be aware that if you are a party of two you will be seated at a European-style two-top close to your neighbors.  This is OK unless said neighbors don't know how to behave and would truly earn any dirty looks they'd garner if they did the same in Paris.  This happened to us.  One of our neighbors was so loud and full of himself he boggled our brains and made us miserable.  We debated getting up and walking up but instead convinced the host to move us instead.  Fortunately all of our new neighbors engaged in much quieter conversation.  We wound up having a very delicious and relaxing lunch here.\n\nWe debated the menu until we saw another diner's vegetable pot pie.  It is so cute!  It's a modest puff pastry box with a lid.  Inside were brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, pearl onions, and maybe something else.  The sauce was delectable.  It was served with a simple yet flavorful side salad.  The vinaigrette leaned on the side of featuring the flavor and texture of the high-quality olive oil, which was a good thing.\n\nWe also enjoyed the grilled sandwich.  This was an umami explosion of broccoli rabe, egg, and bread, with a little sopresata for flavor.  It was served with a slightly different side salad; dressing was more piquant with more emphasis on the vinegar.  This was a good foil for the decadent egg.\n\nWe also shared a double-shot cortado, which we felt was on par with what you'd be served in a European cafe.  Yum.  And it was served in a cute glass.\n\nWe enjoyed our food and time.  The entrees were a tad salty for our tastes but we run very sensitive on the salt-meter.

I was there this Saturday during the Mustache March and the Kentucky derby. The slushies were the highlight of the night and the Bartender were fantastic [even if I almost scared her to death as a penny jumped out at me from my purse and i mistook it for a large bug]\n\nAlways chill always great for getting your first neck-sunburn of the year.

I liked this bar at first but then I left my purse at the rooftop and the bar would not let me back in to go get it because I didn't have my ID. Which is totally reasonable, but I asked them for an escort to bring me up to go find it with me. The employee was so incredibly rude I couldn't believe it. He called me names, he said I \"didn't belong\", he asked me to walk in traffic. The manager was all about backing up his employee and did not apologize once. The manager said there is no way the employee said those things and that he is too \"calm\" to act that way. It was the most ridiculous experience ive have to deal with since being in Pittsburgh. I regret ever going here and giving them my business. If you go here make sure you don't make any errors because they will treat you like complete shit.

This was before the rooftop bar opened.\n\nWe came in, and it was so empty. The tables on the left side were all empty (I'm sure the kitchen was closed by then anyway). They had taken down the half wall that separated the restaurant side from the bar side, so it was all one room downstairs now. So downstairs was almost empty, with just a handful of people at the bar. The 2nd floor was completely empty, and we made our way to the new rooftop bar, where most of the crowd was, but it still wasn't crowded! I was so upset to see it so empty. This place used to seriously be the best. I had to use the bathroom once, and I don't think I've ever seen the women's room without a line, let alone me being the only person in there. It was so strange! There also used to be a beer pong room in the basement that would fill up with people, but all the rooms were closed, so I dunno if it even still exists...\n\nAnyway, my friends and I all got one drink and decided to move on to the next place.

The other go to's for dinner is the baked floridian(in orange juice), and the Rosemary chicken. For breakfast: I would just go for the buffet. There is plenty to choose from and they have a decent breakfast/sausage gravy. Lunch: the buffalo chx wrap, turkey club, and the pot roast sandwich. \nThey have very good pies. The strawberry pie is our favorite. Pretty soon, they should be having their pie special (a slice for $2).\n"}], "RcpBuH5LHNj1v9MT1JK22w": [{"author": "Chuck H.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2019-08-07", "description": "I wanted to try this place for lunch for awhile now and was not disappointed.

It tasted fine but could have been seasoned a bit more. I want to try a fresh piece of chicken right out of the fryer. \n\nCollard greens- 3.7/5\nThe collard greens are exactly what I expected, cooked right with a kick!\n\nCornbread muffin- 4.6/5\nBut the corn muffin... let me tell you about this fluffy, moist, decadent, corn bread muffin... MMMMMMM! I'd be back just for one of these God's gifts to earth.\n\nChicken tenders- 1.8/5\nMy girlfriend got the chicken fingers which sadly, were poorly breaded and very, very dry.

I can't figure out what it might have been, it was more \"chemical\" than herb or spice.

There was no manager available, though the nice woman said I could place a new order on Grubhub, just without ribs (and a few other things they were out of).

This is a gas station, restaurant and hair place rolled into one but separated by 2 doors. Talk about convenience...if you're into weaves n stuff. Lol The restaurant looks like a fast food establishment but nothing was inviting about it. There are signs advertising specials everywhere but they are very confusing because a few of them had different prices for the same combos. You're better off just paying attention to the board behind the counter. To the left of the counter are a few old greasy fryers and based on the looks of them, I doubt they work. No big deal but they're dirty and I just wonder why someone would put them there...of all places. Did I say they are dirty?\n\nThe sides are set up in plain view, just like the picture on here shows.  I'm addition to the items I selected, the case held stewed tomatoes, red beans n rice, stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, corn, green beans and I may be missing something. There were sweets advertised on one of the posters but I don't remember seeing a list of what was available. The chicken is supposed to be the star of the show but, when I visited tonight, it was sitting off to the side with no warmer on and I didn't smell that just fried chicken smell. You know the smell I'm talking about. (Unless you've never fried chicken--- tell me it ain't so!) Anyway, I didn't feel like being inquisitive so I just went with the Quik It bowl which consisted of 2 sides and cornbread for $3.99. I chose greens and Mac n cheese to go. The lady who waited on us was very nice and offered up smiles which I truly appreciate. \n\nWhen I got home and tasted everything, it wasn't bad. I will even venture to say it was tasty.

I'm from NJ/NYC, so this is just as big a staple for us as Pizza! I'm so happy this place opened! This is a family owned business and they are all very friendly! I had the chicken and lamb combo platter as well as the falafel platter. They packed it nicely for me, definitely enough portion. This is Bangladeshi Owned, which is actually awesome! Here's a secret, the best halal carts in NYC are Bangladeshi Owned...they flavor their rice better and add Tandoori spice to their chicken! It's NEXT LEVEL! The falafel was super fresh, chicken and lamb was as well. The highlight is the sauce, it's different than halal guys, a little creamier and heavier but it also has a hint of Dil, like a traditional Tzatziki Sauce! The hot sauce was spicy but not crazy like Halal Guys. BUT still don't get too carried away if you wanna keep your stomach lining in tact haha! Thank you for bringing a bit of home to Pittsburgh! Also this should teach other food establishments, especially local food trucks (not going to name names) that good food doesn't haven't to be $14 for a platter! If you find a place selling you a platter for more than $7, RUN AWAY and put your fist up in protest!\n"}, {"author": "Nik S.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-11-21", "description": "5 stars.

I ordered the combo platter ($7) and made it deluxe (+$2) and the guys working made sure my box was packed with meat. The meats were very tasty and I got a lot of food for the price. I was a bit disappointed by the \"deluxe\" part of the meal, however, as the extra $2 went towards about 3 fries, a few bites of pita, and 1 piece of falafel. Next time I will probably skip the deluxe, as you get a lot of food already without it. I also recommend asking for a lot of white sauce. The meats are well marinated, but you can also ask for the red sauce if you want a bit more of a kick.

On two occasions last week, Kay and I found ourselves exploring it, Challengers of the Unknown that we are. \n\nLocated within a narrow corridor of a storefront, the proprietors own a panini press and a meat slicer and are not above using both to full effect. \n\nTake for instance the masterful Corned Beef panino. A Reuben in sheep's clothing, the meat was ample as was Swiss cheese, the tart sauerkraut, the creamy Thousand Island dressing,  all of contained expertly within toasted rye bread and halved bisected. Salty, creamy, sweet strings were plucked, making for beautiful gastronomic music. Complimented by a large, halved dill pickle, Kay and I longed for a patch of green grass and a blanket. \n\nMama Rea's \"Famous\" Potato Salad came next, quite frankly sending Grandma's to the nursing home for the rest of her days. I couldn't detect much else in the potato salad other than a sugary mayonnaise dressing and some mild herbs (perhaps parsley). There were no eggs, crunchy veggies, or paprika involved. No, this potato salad, featuring thinly sliced discs of spud excelled with an elegance of economy that I'd never encountered before. \n\nDessert was a successfully chewy bake-sale level M&M chocolate chip cookie that put my candy canines to bed happily. \n\nMy second visit centered around the Pizza Dog and the Squid Salad. Grilled in the panin press like the corned beef sandwich, the Smith's weiner was topped with mozzarella, tomato sauce, pepperoni, peppers, and a relish of tomato and red onion, taking it to Chi-Town in a deep pan pleasantly. \n\nThe Squid Salad included chilled, al dente calamari (tentacles and all) and parsley in a simple olive oil/vinegar dressing. Gourmet as all get-out, this could have been served on a fancy plate in more opulent environs for much more than I was charged. It was as if it had been swiped from a table at Il Pizzaiolo via teleportation. Some fafcat musta got my tuna melt instead. \n\nIO Silverrrrr!

I could probably tolerate the food better if it was priced accordingly, but let's be real, they think they're a fine dining establishment with those prices. I could probably justify paying that much if the food was amazing, but it's not. \n\nSecondly, and this is really what drives the 1 star, this place has the worst service of any restaurant in the area.

I was dumbfounded on how poor the service was. Food dropped at the table and no check in from the waitress until about 30 min later, at which point were already done. Then she comes by and says \"desert?\". Not \"how was everything, can I get you anything, etc\". Just \"desert?\". We decline, she drops the check on the table and walks away.

When we first parked outside of the restaurant we saw that they had outdoor sitting and an outdoor bar.  It looked nice.  Luckily it was sunny out and a nice day so we decided to sit outside.    The inside looked nice and it was big but you can't beat sitting outside in the warm weather for lunch.\n\n\n     They let us sit wherever we wanted outside.  You could either sit at the outside bar, you could sit on their high table tops, or they had regular sized tables to sit at as well.  At first we sat on a high top but the table was a little too small for us so we settled for a regular sized table.  The outside area that we were in was covered but they had an uncovered area too in the back.  It was really nice and relaxing outside.  The Sam Adams Oktoberfest was out early so we both ordered the Oktoberfest.  \n\n\n     They gave us a lunch menu and a dinner menu.  We were hungry but it was lunch time so we decided to go for the lunch menu.  The lunch menu is basically the dinner menu just with smaller portions.  I ordered the Salmon Balsamico with a side of sweet potatoes fries and my wife got the same thing but she got a side of vegetables and a side salad.  I really liked my salmon.  It had marinated roma tomatoes, goat cheese, basil, balsamic reduction in it.  The sweet potatoes fries look great and some of the fries tasted really good.  The problem was most of them weren't cooked long enough so they were a little hard in the middle.  The fires that were done were excellent.  I decided to take them home and I warmed them up to make them softer and that worked!  \n\n\n     My wife had a coupon for her birthday so it was a buy one meal get one free.  You really have to sign up for things like this for your birthday if you don't already.  It really saved us a lot of money for her birthday weekend.  Since she had this coupon they knew it was her birthday so the waitress asked if she would like a free Caramelized Walnut Ball.  My eyes got really big because I knew my wife doesn't eat dessert so this would really be for me!  It was a nice gesture from them to give us a free dessert for her birthday.  I did give my wife a bite or two of the walnut ball but I inhaled the rest of that dessert!\n\n\n     Overall we had a really nice lunch date for my wife's birthday.  We sat around after lunch and had a few more beers to enjoy the weather and each other.  It was great.

It's a pretty sweet deal so of course I wanted to take advantage of this offer on my birthday.  We went here for a late lunch after seeing a matinee movie at the nearby cinema.\n\nThe restaurant has a lovely outdoor seating area, and it was a nice afternoon to eat and drink outside.  For lunch I opted for the Salmon Balsamico.  It came with marinated roma tomatoes, goat cheese, basil, balsamic reduction.  I kind of think goat cheese, or any cheese on a piece of fish is let's say fishy to me so I scraped it off.  My husband got the same thing adding some sweet potato fries and myself a side salad.  \n\nService was pretty good, our waitress was attentive, and we didn't wait long for refills.  Our food came out with a normal wait.  I think my husband liked his salmon more than I liked it.  It was cooked well, just thought it could have been seasoned a little better, and the goat cheese, though scraped off lingered on the fish.  I love goat cheese, just not on expensive fish.  If it has cheese on it, it should only be served at a fast food restaurant where you may make claims that it's not real fish.  Speaking of expensive, I thought their prices were a little high verses their portions.  I hate to kick a gift horse in the mouth, but kind of true.\n\n\nNevertheless, we had a very nice afternoon at Walnut Grill and was even given free desert a walnut ice cream ball.  This was much more of a treat for my husband than myself since I believe I had a bite or two and he gobbled the rest of it down.

Why can't they open a restaurant closer to me?  I know that I only have to cross one river to get to the nearest Walnut Grill, but can't they open one up the street from me? :-)!\n\nMe, my family and friends have been to this restaurant many, many times and I can't believe that I have never written a review since it's one of my favorite go-to places.  I think that I have had every single appetizer on the menu, with the exception of the stuffed banana peppers or Seared Tuna Tacos(I just don't like stuffed banana peppers or seared tuna) .  My favorite appetizers are the Pork Dumplings, Fried Pickles and Cheese and Fruit Plate.  You can't go wrong with any of these choices and if you go during their \"Happier Hour\", the prices are reduced to $5 or half.  What's not to like about that?\n\n My favorite go-to dish is the Wild Mushroom Chicken.  Is it a cutting edge dish?  No, but I still love it and I usually add one of their delicious scrumptious crabcakes to go with it. (I hate crabcakes with a lot of fillers and vegegies.  Theirs has neither and \"I die\" for both dishes.  Also not to be missed, if they have any kind of meat shank in season, just order it , eat it, pay for it and go home to recover from a meat coma.  They're just that good.\n\nMy daughter usually orders the Buffalo Chicken Wrap or Shaved Prime Rib Sandwich.  Both are delcious and very filling with your choice of a side dish.\n\nFor the desserts, you can't go wrong with the Brownie Works or Walnut Turtle Meltaway.

They could have been a little more crispy and seasoned, but I would order them again. The Bellini strawtini drink was so good. It was made with champagne and came with a fresh strawberry on the side. Not too sweet which made it perfect. For my main meal I ordered a Caesar salad with salmon. I like food with a little kick to it so I requested the salmon to be cooked blackened which they did with no problem. It was definitely a good Caesar. I would next time get the dressing on the side.

I was somewhat disappointed by the food and I'll explain why. Initially, I was going to give this place three stars, but the entire dining experience made it a four for me.\n\nWhat I love about this place is its commitment to the community and locally sourced ingredients. I absolutely love the way the building has been transformed into this restaurant. I love the decor, the tables, the way the silverware sat, and the tall water glasses. The music was a little loud, but I enjoyed the jams. I also was into the bar and partly open kitchen. An interesting thing I noticed in the bathroom were the smaller mirrors in the stalls versus a giant mirror above the sink. I thought that was neat.\n\nThe staff was fabulous. I loved how we were greeted and sat. Our waitress A'ary was wonderful. Her personality was incredible and she helped us pick some dishes when we couldn't decide. We were shown the menu and explained how we could order from the first, second, and third sections. I asked for a cocktail recommendation and was told that I'd love Tepache, which is exactly what I ordered. It was delicious! The cocktail included green chartreuse, pineapple, bitters, and lime.\n\nNow on to the food. First, I ordered the crab which consisted of Maryland crab, farm egg, grits, spigariello, and bottarga. I think this dish was a play on a southern version. I felt like my egg was a little too runny and there was too much extra greens on my plate. I thought the crab could have been seasoned a bit, but that was my personal taste.\n\nNext, my friend ordered smoked tofu and I got the duck dish. Her tofu had a lot of greens on top along with my dish did too, which we felt was unnecessary as it didn't do anything for the dish. I thought her tofu was bland though she loved her dish minus all of the extra greens. My duck was pretty good. Some pieces had crispy skin and other pieces had fairly chewy skin. I had a few pieces of brussel sprouts in my dish along with cauliflower and I again thought both could have been seasoned more. I didn't love the sauce the duck was sitting on. I think it was blended squash, but it didn't do anything for me.\n\nThen, I ordered a blondie for dessert and it was interesting. I loved the crunch of almonds mixed in along with the blondie itself. I thought the cherry cream was good, but the apples and the foam on top didn't excite me. I personally didn't get the point of it.\n\nCome check out the place as the menu changes. I recommend making reservations ahead of time. They do have a parking lot to the right of the restaurant and there is also street parking.

Make a reservation first since it's not too big, and it certainly gets crowded. It's well worth the drive to a up and coming part of town for the food and ambiance. As you can guess, this building was an old car \"dealership\" - I say \"dealership\" lightly since it's a small building compared to modern car dealerships. They use a lot of locally grown produce when possible curate new dishes to match the season. Come hungry and get an item from each of the courses!

On one hand, I love the creative and bold flavors, the multiple courses, and the superior service.  On the other, everything is so delicious that I want more of it, and fine dining always has such small portions.  Superior Motors sort of bridges the gap for me on this.  All of the dishes I tried were delightful and expertly put together.  And while I did want more of some of the most tasty of items (just because I'm a glutton), I wasn't hungry at the end of my meal.   \n\nFirst, the service.  I was really pleasantly surprised by this.  They definitely have a fine dining feel with lots of servers and a lot of attention to detail, but without all the stuffy pretentiousness that usually comes with it.   Coat check was available and easy.  The servers knew their stuff and were very attentive without being intrusive.  I never wanted for a refill and they helped with selections on wine.  They even got the little stuff, like pulling out my chair when I went to the restroom.  Everyone looked happy to be there and it showed in the service.    \n\nIn addition to the menu, they offered a 3 and 5 course option. Several of the dishes in this option were not on the regular menu.   I selected the 3 course option and added the salmon crudo and the smoked banana dessert from the regular menu.  This essentially gave me the 5 course meal with a different dessert and for a few bucks less than the 5 course option.  The meal came to around $65 and I had several glasses of wine on top of that.   I spent more at Lautrec and was far less satisfied there.   \n\nEach course was beautiful and absolutely delicious.  The chestnut soup was creamy and warm - I wanted more of that.   The truffle risotto was a very nice second course.   The salmon crudo perhaps could have used a little acid or something, but we are splitting hairs there.   The braised beef was tender and covered with a mole that packed in the flavor.  This also came with some parsnips and a sweet potato puree - both were delicious and I wanted more of those.   I ended with the smoked banana dessert, which was a strange combination of flavors and textures that really worked.   The ganache and sweet potato desserts were also outstanding.  \n\nSo why four stars instead of five?  Two things.  First, I generally object to having to pony up a credit card to make a reservation.  I absolutely get why they do it, BUT it does make me think twice about making a reservation for 6 people.   While I would love to think my friends are as responsible as I am, the reality is that stuff happens and I don't really want to be on the hook for all of them.  \n\nSecond (this is really where they lost the star) is the requirement that the entire table do the special multi-course menu or no one can.  I went with a group of 6 ladies - that's 5 other people I had to get on board if I wanted that menu.  One vegetarian or picky eater or cheapskate in the group would have spoiled it for everyone.  The server said it was something to do with the timing of the courses, but I'm just not sure how that's a thing.  Each of us could have made completely random 3-4-5 course meals from the regular menu, so I'm not sure why those particular dishes were harder somehow.  \n\nIn the end, while I was annoyed that my companions were a little pressured into their food choices, the meal was delicious and the service was great.   I'd go back.\n"}, {"author": "Kim G.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2019-11-13", "description": "Eh, Overrated. Over priced. For the trendy crowd not me. Pressed food is weird.

When we arrived we were seated promptly and a very friendly and helpful waiter guided us through the menu and answered any questions we had. He explained to us that in creating the menu they deviated from the traditional style of appetizers, salads, mains, etc to more of a four course selection where you can pick and choose whatever you wanted. The first page is the entire food menu. The pages that follow it consists of your wine or alcoholic beverages. They have a full bar here.\n\nAnything marked with a \"v\" on the menu meant the item was vegetarian but could be made vegan upon request. I began with the carrot tartare that came with seaweed wraps. My husband had the smoked potato with radish. I was literally blown away with how good that carrot tartare was! Even wrapping portions of it in the seaweed made it more delectable. I tasted my husband's smoked potato and wasn't overly impressed with it. \n\nAfter completing these items I had discussed with the waiter about the main courses.

Were any of the dishes we had \"AMAZING\"?  No.  They were fine.  Everything was \"fine.\"  Fancy presentation, but at the end of the day course four was still half a chicken breast with a dollop of greens.  The first course was some arugala with half a strawberry and 2 cubes of rhubarb.  It was fine.\n\nThe staff never asked if we were enjoying a course - but did seem to notice that I didn't like the fish course because at the end he mentioned it and took a drink off the tab to make up for it (which was nice!).

I wish the creativity was translated into the food. We had the duck, pork, and beef. I thought the composition of the pork dish was very focused, but did not understand why they plated the entire dish in one corner of a plate.

Superior Motors is one of those restaurants that I have been looking forward to trying ever since it was introduced maybe 3 years ago.  The slow progress of building it and its location in Braddock meant that it wasn't a place to head to for just any meal.  That's why I waited until my birthday to give it a try.  We had reservations for 7:15 and arrived to the restaurant right around that time.  It was busy inside and we waited about 15 minutes for our table to open up. Whoever it was that was working the front of the house on this day, you could tell he was really busting his butt doing anything he could to help the servers and hostess.  I loved seeing that!  In any case, the inside of the restaurant is certainly interesting.  The walls are brick which gives it an industrial feel and then there are paintings on the wall which my mom thought elementary school students could do. Haha.  They were better than that but certainly more of the abstract variety.\n\nFor dinner on this evening I decided to start off with the crispy pig face appetizer while the rest of the table decided to split the smoked seitan.  The menu described my crispy pig face as coming with vegetarian boudin noir (not sure how that works), black truffle and mustard while the seitan came with popcorn, mango and spruce.  Both were beautiful whenever they came to our table.  My crispy pig face ended up being quite good as it was fried into a rectangular object which ended up having a really intense pork flavor to it.  I especially enjoyed dipping it into the mustard.  Last but certainly not least was the boudin noir which sort of had the consistency and flavor profile of stove top stuffing although not exactly the same. I was also able to try some of the smoked seitan and loved both the smokiness of it and the mango on top of it.  Then for my entree I went with the duck while my wife ordered the salmon.  My duck came with Swiss chard, cashew and rhubarb while my wife's salmon came with white asparagus, sorrel, hazelnut and hollandaise.  I was especially excited about mine as duck and rhubarb are too of my favorite flavors and you so rarely see them together.  Thankfully it didn't disappoint as my meal was delicious.  The duck ended up coming two ways with probably a half of a breast as well as some confit and both parts were cooked perfectly.  Meanwhile the cashew added some texture to the dish while the rhubarb added that sweetness and sourness that it is known for.  My only complaint about the dish was that there wasn't more of it, haha.  My wife and parents also really enjoyed all of their dishes.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.

I prefaced the visit by calling and speaking with Chris Clark, the GM, who asked a few questions about our preferences and then spoke to Chef Sousa. My request was that we didn't want to make any decisions - that we wanted to be surprised and eat until we busted open.\n\nWe went a bit early, which I highly recommend, so we could walk around a bit. SM is located directly across the street from the USS Mon Valley Works Edgar Thomson Plant. I loved that the restaurant really fits into its surroundings and does not overwhelm the neighborhood. Arriving early will also give you a chance to check out the interior and grab a drink.\n\nChris met us when we arrived; and, knowing how busy the reservation book was, recommended that we just sit at the bar. This couldn't have been a more spot on recommendation for us, as we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The bartenders were not just friendly but awesome wait staff themselves. They paired all of our dishes with the perfect choices of IPA, prosecco, saki, and a Greek red wine.\n\nThe food...oh, the food...\n\nWe started with what turned out to be the only challenging dishes for the both of us. My husband had the diver scallop with buckwheat noodles and cuddlefish ink. I had the cobia, with freeze dried avocado noodles (YUM! I could eat a whole bowl!), and a tomatillo/jalapeno/cilantro broth. What was challenging for the both of us was just that we hadn't ever had such unique raw seafood preparations before - so it was just an overwhelming starter - but delicious nevertheless.\n\nFor the next course, I had black cod with sunchokes, kale, and leek. I'll mention here that Chef Sousa's dishes are always loaded with fresh veg - and the veg are always prepared with multiple cooking techniques to keep the flavors and textures constantly evolving based on what's on your fork next. My husband had the salmon, with white asparagus, sorrel, hazelnut, and a hollandaise. Again, the textures and flavors here were morphed with every bite.\n\nFor the next course, I had a chicken dish that was so reminiscent of my Nana's funsei (a South American dish) that I got all choked up with nostalgia - but I still managed to gobble down what was an outstanding chicken dish. My husband had the veal with ricotta, asparagus, and fiddleheads. What an incredible combination of meat, cheese, and veg! I could have eaten a whole platter of this.\n\nOverall, Chris and Chef Sousa picked the ideal combination of dishes for us: challenging, comforting, and downright delicious all around. At this point, we were pretty full from cruising through the menu; however, the pasta was calling to me...\n\nWe ordered one last savory course to share - the house made pappardelle with egg, watercress, and cauliflower. As a carnivore myself, I couldn't have loved this veg dish more. It was like the great red wine we were sipping: delicate and still packing a bold flavor punch.\n\nAny regular diner would have thrown in the napkin - but not us! We finished our journey with the ganache, yuzu, lime dessert. Chocolate with citrus is probably one of my favorite combos so I was a happy camper. \n\nI will warn the frugal spender: Superior Motors is quite pricey; however, you 100% get what you pay for, which, in this case, is superior service, libations, and food. And if that's not enough, remember what Chef Sousa is doing for the neighborhood and Braddock Youth Project kids; about how he both reclaimed and re-visioned the history of the building itself; and, the fact that products are sourced from area vendors.\n\nIt is easy to see why 'Food & Wine' considers Superior Motors to be the Restaurant of the Year. I look forward to seeing Chef Sousa continue to grow.

Was blown away by how friendly and accommodating the staff was. Before arriving I called to inquire about what entrees could be adjusted for a vegan. The woman on the phone was so happy to walk me through the menu and discuss which items could be adjusted and made vegan (several of them!--basically just omitting the cheese). All the pictures looked so good, so I knew I was in for a treat. \n\nThe restaurant itself is so clean, simple and elegant. From big half circle booths, tons of tables, to the bar, and even a back dining area, the restaurant was definitely very large. So nice that my party of four was seated at a large booth and not crammed at a four person table. Our table was ready the second we walked through the doors and our waiter arrived within moments of us sitting down. Definitely would recommend a reservation as it was quite crowded at 5 PM on a Sunday. \n\nOur waiter walked us through the menu and was happy to describe all dishes in further detail. My table ended up ordering the beef entr\u00e9e, sturgeon, and mushroom risotto. Holy heck was the mushroom risotto perfection. The rye and pearl barley was a perfect al dente and really made the meal feel super hearty and filling. It was topped with just two tiny tiny slices of mushroom. My only complaint is compared to both the beef & fish entr\u00e9e which were quite large, the portion size of the risotto was teeny tiny--almost appetizer size. Felt that as being an entr\u00e9e it definitely should have been a bigger portion. Although aside from the size, the taste was absolutely exquisite. It was made vegan by omitting the goat cheese and WOW was it amazing. For dessert they had four options and our waiter advised us the further down the list you go, the less traditional the desserts became. Fortunately the coconut dessert was vegan and also last on the list, it was super unique and so very delicious. We also ordered the pear tart and my party absolutely loved it. So sweet they even put a candle on the dessert for my boyfriend's birthday. Loved everything about our meal here, and I can't wait to get back again in the near future.\n"}, {"author": "Danielle F.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-04-06", "description": "First time at Superior Motors with a group of 4 and it was great.

We did not have dessert. Shout out to our server Vondre who we loved. He brought us a complimentary Salmon and took us into the kitchen at the end of our meal.

So when your favorite pizza place starts changing their ingredients after 15 years of being a loyal customer, it's time to go exploring.  We are on our fifth restaurant and may possibly have a winner, although I feel further trials may be in order.  Went to Than's Amore Pizza on Butler Street in Lawrenceville for the first time last night.  The shop looks great, the people were professional, but the girl behind the counter needs to get off her cell phone and come up for air every once and awhile.  The Chef was precise, fast and more than qualified to put together a pizza.  The pizza was very good.  Ordered mushroom and sausage.  The mushrooms were plentiful and very good.  It was, however, a bit difficult to see any sausage on board.  Good cheese and a nice crust.\nDoesn't anyone toss dough  anymore?  My favorite part of a pizza is when the erratic edges of a tossed pizza bubble and burn a bit.  That's the best for me.  This is what keeps my quest on-going.

We noticed Pizza Amore as we drove by but wrote it off as another \"probably only good while drunk\" pizza joint, until I decided to Yelp it.  4.5 stars?!  We had to give it a shot.\n\nWhile we had beers next door at Remedy while waiting for the pizza to be made, we overheard some other beer drinkers raving about how amazing the homemade meatballs at Pizza Amore were.  A totally out-of-the-blue coincidence. Good thing we had ordered meatballs on half of our pizza!\n\nWhen we finally got the pizza, we were so pleasantly surprised at how much better it was than what we had expected based on the shop front.  The crust was very tasty, just the right mixture of chewiness and crispiness, and just the right tinge of sweetness.

In addition to shawarma you can also order a hummus wrap or for an upcharge of either $1.00-$2.00 depending upon the meat you choose, you can have it as a salad.\n\nThe falafel shawarma which I was hoping on getting was unavailable for purchase. The chicken shawarma uses chicken thigh as its base. The beef shawarma uses the prime of the meat. I learned that if you order a shawarma and a side of French fries then you can get a free bottled water or canned soda.\n\nI decided to go with the beef shawarma and as I was waiting it to be prepared I learned that it is hand staked as I was watching them cut my meat. It comes with pickled turnips-an unusual but very tasty addition along with the typical lettuce, tomatoes, and onions that normally accompany it.\n\nI would advise to stock up on napkins because this thing gets messy. They have plenty of them at the truck. The beef shawarma was a bit tough in some places and outside of the fact it seemed cold (I'm attributing the cold weather to that one) it was otherwise very tasty. The size is very generous for the price and makes a satisfying meal otherwise.\n\nPita My Shawarma has its own website with a partial listing of their menu items.

The usual menu items are available as well as their renown soup and salad bar. My turkey dinner came with stuffing, gravy, and a side of my choice. It was very good. Pumpkin pie and cake is now in season so make the most of it while you have the opportunity. A person in our group had the rosemary chicken which is another one of my favorites and it did not disappoint. \n\nThis Eat n Park has the new check service. You don't have to take your check to the pay area. Prices are very reasonable and you can get a good meal or sandwich or whatever you are interested in. They do change the daily soup menu but they always have chili and chicken noodle soup on the salad bar. It's right off an exit at Banksville Road headed away from the city.\n\nDefinitely the place for smiles!\n"}, {"author": "Henry W.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2019-01-21", "description": "I had been fasting for blood work this morning and reallly needed food.

Oh is it ever! Eat & Park really knows how to make dining a streamlined experienced. They are the classic Pittsburgh family establishment.

The menu options are extensive. They have something for everyone's dining needs- diabetic, allergies, celiac, small portions for kids & seniors, picky eaters... it's amazing just what they've thought of! I can't think of any other restaurant in the country that offers what Eat N Park does! \n\nOur family has many favorites- just to name a few, the chicken soup is heavenly. As is the fish sandwich w mac & cheese during Lent. There are just so many choices- it really is almost impossible to review just one meal. The thing about Eat N Park is that the menu is straightforward & the calories, ingredients, and all details are readily available upon request. This makes finding a dish that suits ones individual tastes easy and exceptional. Personally, I think you can't go wrong with the hot turkey sandwich & French fries - all covered in gravy. Delicious!  So very delicious!  \n\nAnd we can't forget to mention the Smiley Cookies. They are iconic! Do not leave without having one if you're dining for the first time! The Smiley Cookies are absolutely the best part. Or maybe the stickies are. Or the the pies. No. The Smiley Cookies are the best... or maybe the stickies.  They are all so amazing!

I scoured Yelp for recommendations and this spot popped to the top of the list.\n\nWe sat at a booth table in the bar area and settled in with our beer and cider orders.

The vibe there is very \"local\" where the servers seemed to know everyone who came through the door (except us! ha!) and folks appeared to be having a good time.\n\nOn to the meal review, however. We ordered a house salad, a burger to share and an order of wings. The salad was chopped lettuce, carrots and cabbage and was clearly from a bag. Nothing special to say the least. Our standard cheeseburger was most likely frozen and thrown on a grill given its shape and how it was cooked, but it was served atop a terrible, chewy bun straight out of a bag. The saving grace to the meal were the buffalo garlic parmesan wings, which we found pretty decent with a mild tangy flavor from the sauce and parm cheese combined.\n\nWish there was more to say about this place...although the atmosphere was chill, the food left a lot to be desired.\n"}, {"author": "Rachel W.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2019-05-21", "description": "We randomly stumbled across this place and it doesn't look like much on the outside but the reviews I read seemed promising so we decided to just see what happened. \n\nThey were super busy but only had one person working the bar/tables.

To my surprise, the place was PACKED with people.\n\nOur waitress(who seemed to be the only one as she was running around the whole building checking on the customers), finally approached our table and asked what we would like to order. One of my partners asked for a salad and the other asked for the chicken tenders, while I ordered the smokehouse burger.\n\nI knew there should have been suspicion about the food, since the waitress had a difficult time describing the salad to my partner, having only said \"it's like what's in a regular salad\" and recited a list of what is suppose to be in a salad, such as lettuce, dressing, and to my partners surprise, pickles.\n\nA solid 30-45 minutes had passed and the food had finally came, well, to everybody accept my order. As my partners were experiencing in on the salad and the chicken, I waited another 3 minutes for my smokehouse burger to arrive. And I was SHOCKED.\n\nWhat my eyes detected first was the use of white toast bread( uncooked and not even toasted), When I expected the traditional brown buns to appear. The smokehouse burger consisted of onion rings, teriyaki sauce, bacon, and cheese, which luckily it had all the components. \n\nThe burger was too big to put in a human-sized mouth. I have made a couple of attempts to eat the sand which like a burger, however the size of the burger was overpowering. I asked my waitress for a fork and knife to help dissect this behemoth. \n\nAs fast as I had put the food in my mouth was the same speed I wanted to spit out the bite. First. The teriyaki sauce was inconsistent with the burger, as there were large patches of the sauce in some areas of the burger while the others were scarce. The onion ring was probably made with poorly made batter and the crust couldn't hold on to the onion itself. The bacon, however, was crisp and it is what you would expect from bacon, light, tasty, crunchy. \n\nNow here's the real disappointment. The party itself was BLAND. Absolutely no seasoning in it, not even salt and pepper. The cook of the burger was well done and I couldn't take another bite from that sandwich. \n\nAside from my plate, my partner had tasted the table ketchup and she found a weird taste in it. I took a sample of the ketchup in the bottle and it tasted old and warm, which should not be a characteristic of ketchup.\n\nAnd to top it all of, one of the customers sitting at the bar was arguing over the loud music to another customer and at a server.

My sashimi lunch platter was very disappointing. When you order sashimi you don't expect three pieces of it to be crab stick. The tuna was so salty that I could not eat it. I had to ask for the soup came with my meal. We had to ask for our waters as they only brought out enough for half of the table. Egg roll came out cold. The only reason for the three stars is that the manager was apologetic and the fact that several people in my party, especially those who ordered the shrimp tempura, were really pleased.\n"}, {"author": "Jackie R.", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2017-09-11", "description": "Ordered take out from my office downtown.

Don't get me wrong the food isn't that good either but when you're in a pinch and want some greasy Chinese food this place will do. The place is old I get it but when you walk in you can tell the place is hasn't been maintained in a while. They are way understaffed. They have 2 waitresses for the entire lunch rush which doesn't make sense. The waitress I had seemed super stressed out. We had to wait to get seated. The poor old white lady forgot to take our order, then forgot to get our food. When we went to leave there was no one to ring us out. \n\nWhen they bring you hot tea they just took it from the table before you that left. The water sits in prefilled glasses on a cart in the corner of the restaurant. They wiped down a dirty table with a gross and used rag. I'm assuming the general tsos sits in a bin I'm the kitchen that's why it always comes out first.  I got the pork lol mein. It was pretty tasty. \n\nThis ain't no Sesame Inn. Not even the same caliber as Chinatown in. At least it's a little better than that fu lai place. \n\nI'm not trying to be harsh, he'll I'm proud to admit to be a Chinese American.

The d\u00e9cor is a bit dated, and I'm wary of Chinese restaurants that throw in Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese dishes, as though Chinese doesn't offer enough variety on its own...but it's not exactly a criminal offense.  Most of the other diners ordered Gen. Tso chicken, which is the baseline dish that I usually order and judge all Chinese restaurants by to see if it stands up to my beloved House of Chen in Cranberry, but this time I was feeling wild.  I ordered steamed pork dumplings and the lunch special with a shrimp eggroll, eggplant garlic, and steamed rice.  Everything tasted lovely, though there were about 2 teeny shrimpies in my roll and the rest was pretty much just the shredded cabbage.  The dumplings were nice and big and delicious, and that eggplant garlic was anything but boring.  I took about half of it home, and was sluggish and sleepy for the rest of the day.  So...portion sizes are not an issue, unless you're un-American and don't like them big.  The tea tasted a bit weak.  Not that that's my main draw, but come on..it's TEA in a Chinese restaurant.  Bring your tea game up.  \n\nAll of this said, I'm sure I'll be back at some point, now that I know there's a solid Chinese restaurant with ample seating downtown.\n"}, {"author": "HN S.", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2015-02-13", "description": "With today being National Chopstick Day, I braved the frigid, 11 degree, February cold for a Chinese lunch at the Mandarin Gourmet.  This spacious restaurant was already getting a respectable crowd when I walked in around noon-time. I was quickly seated at a booth and given a menu to look over.\n\nThe lunch specials seemed very reasonably priced and I looked over my choices hoping to see chicken or beef lo-mien. Discovering that that wasn't an option I decided on the sweat n' sour shrimp with a bowl of hot n' sour soup. \n\nA tin pot of hot tea was placed at my table and I thought, \"What a nice touch\". My hot and sour soup followed shortly behind. \n\nThe soup was thick with tofu and the broth of the soup had almost a syrupy consistency (in a good way).  I was beginning to like this place. It didn't take very long for the main dish to arrive and it came beautifully presented. I was really believing that this place was a new gem that I discovered then I took a bite into one of the sweet n sour shrimp rings and was oh so totally disappointed. \n\nRemember that old commercial \"Where's the beef\"? Well that's almost what went through my mind... \"Where's the shrimp?\" All you could taste and all you could see was this doughy coating.  I decided to dissect one of the rings and I was able to locate the tiniest, shrimpiest of shrimp. Don't believe me?  Take a look at the pic I took of it. It's that mess on the napkin. The shrimp is on top and the dough is on the bottom.\n\nI looked over at another table and there was a gentleman who got a broccoli and shrimp dish and his shrimp were big and plump and healthy looking compared what I got. I guess since his shrimp wasn't wearing a doughy disguise and were in plain view, the proprietors of the Mandarin Gourmet felt that they couldn't get away with serving the sickliest of shrimp to him. \n\nJudging by what I saw on the plates of other patrons and from the crowd that they get, I'm thinking that I just choose the wrong dish today. I'm planning on coming back sometime soon and trying a menu item that doesn't have the opportunity to camouflage itself and perhaps boost my rating of this place.

I left early today to check out this new bakery. It's took over the old Sweets and Treats location in Dormont on West Liberty Avenue.\n\nFirst, this owner is facing some of the same challenges as the previous owner, Daarko.There is on-street parking, which means you pay a meter and walk across to the bakery. Your other option is to pay for parking in the lot next to R.B.'s Pizza, formerly Joe & Pie). Either way, you're still crossing four lanes of insanely busy traffic on West Liberty Avenue. God help you if you are balancing more than one baked good back to your car, and/or have kids in tow. Use the crosswalk, and pray no one blows the light.\n\nStyle-wise, the bakery is decorated somewhat similar to the previous bakery, but the actual furnishings are different.\n\nI walked in, the only customer, smiled and said hi. The lady behind the counter, while polite, was not the warm, outgoing owner that Daarko (previous owner) was.  She stated hi, and asked what she could get me. I browsed the cupcake and brownie case, which is almost directly across from the door. I asked what they were, and the prices. The woman asked which one. I said all. She apologized as she went for a list, and read each one. The peanut butter cupcakes were $1.79/each. They were chocolate cake, with a very small dollop of peanut butter filling and topped with peanut butter flavored buttercream frosting. I got one, and also a slice of vegan banana bread (I know a vegan, so I'm always on the lookout for treats she can eat). The woman commented she made them for (last) Saturday,  the grand opening. Oh geez! I was hoping they weren't dry. It was $1, so I took a chance. Still, $1 for 4-day old banana bread (assuming she made them early Saturday morning)? Not good. Some of the cupcakes were individually packaged, and labeled with a letter. I asked her what E meant. She said it was F, for Filled, and P, for Plain. She said her young kids helped label. Good for her! What a great bonding family experience!\n\nShe sells cookies (2/$6), coffee, and icecream. I asked the woman, who never introduced herself, if she was the owner. She was. I asked her what made her decide to open a bakery. Life-long dream? Nope. She lost her job just before Christmas, and decided she didn't want to work for anyone, and always wanted to open her own business. The store was already set up to function as a bakery, so she figured it would be easy, I guess.\n\nShe (Josie? I mean she could have named it after her mother, kid, or cat) was polite and responsive, but a bit disorganized. Everything was not labeled what the item was, or with the price. She kept referring to a list. Ok, her business is only 4 days old. She's working out the kinks. She's married, and has kids to boot. I get it. But hey, she's trying her dream of being a business owner, so kudos to her. \n\nThe cupcake's frosting  wasn't doing well in my car, so I ate it 15 minutes later. It was dry, had a rather rough texture, had a nickel-size dollop of peanut butter filling, and buttercream frosting. I wondered if the owner made these for her grand opening,  too. It tasted okay. I liked a fine texture in cakes and cupcakes, so I use sifted pastry flour and sift it more. I was not impressed with the frosting. It was not the texture one would expect of buttercream, and very bland. \n\nI did get a taste of the vegan banana bread. The consensus was that it was dry and tasted okay; nothing special. I like moist, flavorful banana bread with nuts (I don't have allergies, and I'm not a vegan/vegetarian or pescatarian).\n\nI love biscotti. She sells small (mini) biscotti, too. They're $.75/each piece, but sold in bags of 4. Pricey! I make my own; they're so easy,  and impress the heck out of people. \n\nBottom line: nice, polite owner. Bakery on a very busy street, comes complete with parking headaches, and lugging stuff across said very busy street. Baked goods I had were dry. And well-liked, established bakeries are very close by (i.e. Potomac Bakery with 2 locations).\n\nI love supporting small businesses,  but I just can't see this one surviving.

Now given the fact that this establishment was extremely busy and is right next to PNC park, I understand the hectic work environment and amount of patience you must have to endure working in that. So here is my review.\n   We arrived at a reasonable time to be able to get a table, around 430-5 on a game night. We put our name in, which works of a text message system, and then sat at the bar for a few beers. The place was extremely crowded, but only took a couple minutes to get our drinks. We only had to wait for 30 minutes and then were sat. \n     Now, even though there was plenty of space to spread the tables out, we were still squeezed between other tables. About 4 other table groups and we were all squashed like sardines. They seemed to have an excuse for EVERYTHING. But anyway. It took a good 5-6 minutes to get the server. We ordered the fried pickle backs, a garden salad with ranch, and the st pattys melt. The fried pickles were more like a fried pickle chopped into small pieces, mind you this was $9!! They were not very good, the sauce it came with was though. I would NOT recommend ordering this.I did inquire about the small portion to the food runner and he said it was because the owner wants them cut like that. Ooook. The salad was huge and the dressing was thick. The sandwich was alright too, but the bead was a little hard or crispy.\n   The attention we received from the server was very minimal. Once we received our check we did not see our server again. They were setting up for an event where we were seated, so it was a little uncomfortable. Feeling of being rushed and the glares the remaining tables were getting. Another server ended up having to check us out. The bottom of the receipt was hilarious to me, also a little infuriating. Another table laughed as they read it too.\n   Basically, if your going to come here on a game day, just order drinks from the bar.\n"}, {"author": "Jennifer G.", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2014-08-29", "description": "This place was pretty awful.  We only went here because the friends we were meeting made the choice.\n\nFirst, it is insanely loud.  Like hurting your ear drums loud.  There was absoutely no reason for it.  It isn't a dance club at 5:30 in the afternoon. You are trying to eat a meal and have to shout to actually talk to your dining companions.  They were clearly targeting men with the way the servers were all dressed.  Two of them were actually showing butt cheek.  Our server was very attentive until she noticed that the three guys with us all had wedding rings on.  Then she was basically MIA for most of the evening.  We saw the shot girls and miller light girls more than we saw our server.\n\nFood was mediocre at best.  I didn't expect anything outstanding, but it was clear most of the items were purely frozen items that were reheated.  We waited quite a bit (but they were busy) but two people's orders were cold. It was pretty obvious it had been out for a while and the server didn't pick it up for whatever reason.\n\nPerhaps the most egregious thing was the prices.  I get it is a bar near the stadiums, so the entree prices were high but not unacceptable.  However, I asked for extra celery and was told there would be a $3 charge.  Three dollars for four pieces of celery?!  Extra blue cheese was also insanely over priced.  Most places will give you celery for free or maybe charge fifty cents.  But three dollars?!  And when I questioned the price the server said \"does that mean you don't want it?  It's not that expensive\"\n\nIf you are a 21-25 year old single male, maybe you would enjoy this place.

Honestly the main reason we ended up at McFaddens was because all of the other places closer to the venue had 90+ minute waits to be seated. The place was basically empty. The bar seating was pretty full but other than that, only 3-4 tables were occupied in the whole place. \n\nIt took about 10 minutes for someone to come over and take a drink order. 10 minutes later the waitress comes with 1 beer, and tells me they are refilling the keg of the Sam Adams summer ale that I ordered. Okay, fine. Another 10 minutes and she comes by and says they're actually out of the summer ale, so I ordered a Summer shandy. \n\nWe were waiting for another couple to join us, and by the time they got there, my boyfriend was just about finished with his beer while I still hadn't even received mine. The waitress promptly came over to take their drink orders (they got the special which was $4 bud light bottles.. Not much of a special really) and asked me if I wanted the special too. Pretty sure she totally forgot about my summer shady. \n\nTook about 10-15 minutes for her to come back with the rest of our drinks. We figured we better order while she was there. \n\nWe ordered chicken sandwiches and wraps.

You can barely fit 4 to a booth but doable. \n\nLike most diners you will find advertising written all over the table. We were given a menu.

Along with the fish sandwich those are the only two items served with fries. The rest are served with potato chips.\n\nOur friend got his usual ham with two eggs over easy, breakfast potatoes and toast. My husband opted for a turkey club. While I love omelets I noticed that they didn't offer egg whites. Time did not permit me to ask about that because the omelets are made with 3 eggs along with breakfast potatoes and toast of your choice.\n\nThe food came out piping hot and I was amazed at the size of my chicken patty. It was placed in a six inch hoagie roll. Needless to say it was very good and quite filling. The others told me they enjoyed their dishes as well. \n\nOur waitress tried her best to be attentive to our needs but with a packed house which I would imagine comes from the after church crowd it can get to be hectic.

If you're looking for beer, the place next door, D's Six Pack and Dogs, is where you want to be.  But it doesn't hurt that the Map Room has a full bar and a few quality beers on tap as well.\n\nThis Irish inspired pub sports a limited menu of regular items and an ever changing variety of daily specials. This evening I had a choice of either chicken parm on angel hair pasta or marsala creamed pork chops.  Since I had chicken for lunch I went with the pork chops.  It came with a tasty bowl of Irish stew and the chops didn't take very long at all to follow. \n\nMy dish had two chops coated with marsala cream, a baked potato with sour cream and real bacon bits on top and a grilled veggie meddly of tomatoe, zucchini and Brussels sprouts.

We walked in and looked for a hostess stand or something to dictate if we should seat ourselves, when a bartender yelled that we can just sit anywhere. The dining room side of the room was almost full with two large tables and duos of people, but we got a seat and waited.\n\nAnd waited. And waited. After awhile a clearly overwhelmed server came over and read us the specials, which was our main draw to the restaurant in the first place. From the outside this just looks like another neighborhood bar and grille joint that doesn't take its food too seriously, but the menu is a bit more upscale barfood inspired. Though I'm not sure they hit all the marks on everything they wanted to accomplish, it was better than most comparable establishments I've been to.\n\nAfter hearing the specials, we ordered the loaded cheese fries appetizer and waited a good bit for menus to be brought over. I'm not complaining about the service--when our server could get to us amidst her 10 or so other tables, she was great. The problem is that she was the only one on a busy Sunday night and clearly wasn't used to that sort of pressure.\n\nI ordered the Regent Square with steak on a baguette and my friend ordered be A1 black strap burger with bacon. We also tried the crab and corn chowder and the cream of mushroom.\n\nThe scratch made cheese sauce was great, and you could tell the fries were handmade. The crab soup left a lot to be desired. My sandwich was just alright--the bread was great, but the steak was in large chunks and not sliced which made some bites a bit more difficult to chew than others. The flavors were all there, but again it missed the mark for me. It would have done well with a sauce of some sort.\n\nI heard a table complain behind us about how long their food was taking and the server said she explained before that it is scratch made kitchen and the food takes a lot of time. I can assure you that my table wasn't informed about the scratch made kitchen, but we excused the long wait times because it was clear the place was overwhelmed. There was nary a sign on the menu or posted anywhere that mentioned how long the cooking times would be. I don't mind waiting if that means good food is on the way, but I feel as if that is something that absolutely should be mentioned up front so the diner can adjust their expectation.\n\nAll in all, my experience here was fairly good and I wouldn't mind trying it again. I'll just remember to allow myself extra time :)\n"}, {"author": "Janice K.", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2017-12-02", "description": "This place has some good beer but it's really kind of gross inside and is essentially a dive.

Initially I was in the mood for deep-fried goodness, so we ventured to D's Six Pax and Dogz.  Unfortunately, D's doesn't serve food after 10pm on the weekends.  Luckily, The Map Room was open, and the kitchen was still making food.\n\nWe sat down and were greeted by our friendly waiter. While we continued to search for an entr\u00e9e we ordered fried zucchini and crab cakes.  We were also served some tasty local beers- delicious!\n\nOur appetizers came in 10 minutes, and we quickly dug in.  The zucchini was perfectly fresh, and hand breaded.  A tasty dipping sauce was a nice accompaniment for the crispy veggies.  Homemade crab cakes were equally as good.  Large chunks of sweet crab, breadcrumbs, and egg bound the saut\u00e9ed cakes together.  A mild tartar sauce complimented the pronounced flavor of the dish.\n\nHouse salads came before our entrees.  Fresh greens, ripe cherry tomatoes, large slices of red onion, fresh (homemade) croutons, and herbs made for a flavorsome mixture.  The homemade blue cheese dressing was sweet, and creamy.\n\nEntr\u00e9e were next.  I chose the fish and chips.  Large portions of fresh fish were served with hand-cut fries.  Rich beer batter coated the perfectly cooked, golden brown fish.  The fries were crispy, and well seasoned.  My dinner mates chose risotto, and pasta with mushrooms with veggies- both dishes were delicious.\n\nThe food at the Map Room is sophisticated, and enjoyable.  The prices are moderate for the area.

It was not edible. The Caesar salad was a joke. The dressing was in a container. I opened it to add it to the salad and it was very thin and watery. It was not classic Caesar dressing. It had a very strong vinegar taste. I did not taste any parmesan cheese. The lettuce was brown on the edges. I only had four and a half pieces of chicken. It was burnt and mostly black.

I'll start by saying we did have a pretty good time over all but the reason for the 2 star rating is that the one bartender, an older bald headed man was completely rude and homophobic.  During karaoke he would yell from behind the bar to shut the F* up.  ummm its karaoke night.. .you're going to have drunk people up there singing... it wasn't just us... everyone was having a great time!   He had 2 friends that I think were co workers (one was the bouncer) sitting at the corner of the bar that he would go whisper to and they would all look over at us and laugh.  It made us very uncomfortable but we chose to stay because we were having fun singing and we made friends with a lot of people in the bar.   He also would not serve us... When we went up to the bar he would look at us and walk away and we would have to wait on the friendly blonde bartender to come serve us.  When Karaoke ended at 1:30 he just went over and flipped the power off and said Time to get out, go home, no more singing.  The DJ explained to us that hes an ass and not normally there on Wednesdays and that we should come back again because we are fun.  He was also doing so many shots behind the bar i'm not sure if he is really that rude or if he was just drunk but I feel like if he is like this all the time time then his time in the service industry should come to an end. There are gay people every where and the bar was filled with them.. not just us and You should never be made to feel uncomfortable in an establishment that you are paying money at so get over it.  The blonde bartender, the woman in the leopard shirt, the young bus boy, the guy in the black polo that was running everywhere and the DJ were all great and like I said we had a fun time even facing the homophobic bouncer and bartender and we could have left at any point but we shouldn't be made to feel we have to leave.

The Waitresses were all friendly and helpful even when they were very busy. The night before Thanksgiving is always a crazy bar night and I'm sure most bartenders and waitresses hate it but nonetheless the female bartender and waitresses were wonderful. The older bald gentlemen bartender although is a different story. Through the night watching him take shots behind the bar is all fine and cool but clearly he forgot where he works ....ya know ....at a karaoke bar. His constant shouting of obscenities after every song sung by patrons at the bar started to get really old halfway through the night. Hearing him shout shut the f*** up, sit down, oh my God shut the f*** up to me was at least disconcerting considering the fact that although he may be a 150 years old he does work at a KAROKEE bar. I know many other people heard his repetitive offensive remarks and it continued until the end of the night where he shut off the power to the DJ's karaoke computer mid song when a couple were singing. I spoke to the DJ about this bartender and his comments, and he assured me he's not usually there Wednesdays, and he also told me that with him shutting off the power at his booth it messed up his programming and hard drive on his computer for the karaoke. And for clarification purposes no, I'm not some bitter tone-deaf person who is just upset at some idiot bartenders remarks. I'm simply someone who was there having fun with a bunch of my friends and couldn't help but notice his derogatory comments towards everyone. So in conclusion I guess I would say to that indeed HE should be the one that should shut the f*** up, because other than him this place is an absolute blast!\n"}, {"author": "Renee S.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2016-12-19", "description": "First time at Bobs garage!

The greeter has you sign in with your email, name and birthday - because of this they send you promotions and offer VIP tables for your birthday and with a certain number of guests - you qualify for a free pizza, discounted drinks, etc at your own table area that evening. Therefore we took that offer a few different times.\n\nI have to say that this place is just okay - its nothing special and therefore not my favorite. I have only tried their pizza which I couldn't really rate as it was just used to soak up alcohol to drink more. When you get the VIP package - you get $3 well drinks and draft beers --- the selection of these is pretty lacking but with the deal it doesn't seem as bad, however they are very off tasting. I couldn't put my finger on it but it wasn't good and I've tried the same IPAs and other beers before and they didn't taste the same. \n\nOur waitress that served our table was very attentive and nice. I think she took a couple drinks back for us and got new ones as they were that bad. With the VIP package we did get a bottle of liquor towards the later part of the night with mixers (cranberry juice and orange juice) and glasses for our whole party. It wasn't bad but I think the retail value they suggest for the bottle is very inflated ($110) which I guess is the bar price but I would never pay that for some subpar vodka. When you are the birthday guest ---- your drinks are one penny but if I recall correctly that is very limited in choice. Understandable.\n\nI guess the reasons this place isn't great are the drinks are just ehhh, the music is very random and has no flow - it will be bumping for a few songs then just some off the wall song that changes the whole vibe, the guests trying to dance have very pitiful space --- granted its not a club, the way the environment is on weekend evenings it is really no different.\n\nI think this place is better for maybe happy hour but isn't awesome for a night out with friends in the evening despite the little deals here and there.\n"}, {"author": "Jeff T.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2018-11-29", "description": "It is a nice place to visit for drink and get some fat food.

Buckhead Saloon is CERTAINLY NOT THAT PLACE.\n\nRecently, we had a formal event at Buckhead, and since our club is for all ages and majors, we have some members that are 18, 19, and 20, which is obviously under the legal drinking age. At EVERY OTHER PLACE that we have ever booked, the underagers have been treated fairly and kindly even though they were not served drinks. At this poor excuse for a proper bar and restaurant, the underage membersof our club (even though no laws or rules were broken by them or any other member in attendance) were treated as second-class citizens. We are still not sure if this is because the management/bartenders knew that they couldn't get extra drink money from them or what, but regardless, the underage members of our club who were trying to enjoy their last event of the semester were treated very poorly by bouncers and management alike.\n\nI find it soooo interesting how Buckhead Saloon RARELY replies to college student complaints on Yelp, even though there are exclusively bad complaints about similar formal experiences...just goes to show you that they do not care about their young customers whatsoever. Good to know!!\n\nAs a club, we regret booking any sort of event with Buckhead Saloon. After many rude and (FALSE) accusatory comments made by bouncers and management to underage members of our club, we are HAPPY to announce that we will never, ever be back, and we will certainly spread the word to other clubs on campus about the awful experience that we had at this place.

We were very patient for quite a while and tried to be understanding, the food wasn't all that great but we were hungry and had to get going so we ate.

I have been employed with this county for 22 1/2 years and certainly know you don't charge any alcoholic beverages to the county credit card; but regardless, I absolutely HATE beer as does my assistant, so I know we didn't get beer that night.

Three phone calls and two weeks later I finally spoke with someone who rudely tells me they can't refund everyone that calls and says they didn't get something on their bill.  WHAT?

The next night, after the reception, we told our 150 guests to head to Buckheads again for an after party. \nThe bride did not have her ID (as most brides don't walk around carrying a purse or their ID as they are most likely over 21, have been drinking already at their wedding, and generally don't get asked for their ID because they are a bride). Also she is 25. So, when the bride arrived at Buckheads (wearing her wedding gown) without her ID she was denied entry because she did not have an ID. However, the night before when she had booked the party and paid the tab, she was not asked for her ID. The staff obviously already knew her, knew she had booked a party the night before, and half the wedding guests were already at the bar.

And as well as a buffalo chicken pizza that was good but pretty hard to mess up. Decided to come here again to give it another go and this time got there big New York style pizza. The pizza it's self was HUGE but the first thing that comes to mind was how soggy and soft the crust was. I got the hot honey and that was definitely pretty good tasting on the pizza but other than that it just tasted so bland. I also got a order of the stuffed rolls with the bacon cheese and jalape\u00f1os. I have to say being they where half priced made it a good deal. They where good by there self but the dipping sauce tasted like 1000 island dressing and all you could taste was relish in it. For a place that won awards for the best pizza it sure does lack in a lot of areas and the dough seems to be nothing fantastic. On a positive note the server both times was very nice but overall I highly doubt I'll be returning here in the future.\n"}, {"author": "Jenee S.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-09-15", "description": "We finally decided to come back after the hype went down.

We snagged a table by the old Coca Cola machine which was a nice spot! \n\nWe ordered both the mozzarella sticks appetizer (for me) and the chicken wings (for him). The mozzarella sticks were certainly just frozen-to-fryer and the sauce was just blah.\n\nHe asked for a sauce recommendation for his chicken wings, and our waitress offered the honey sriracha since it was award winning. It was very spicy, and he had a mixed review- it was interesting and tasty, just not something he'd order again. Not knocking the sauce at all, it just wasn't his taste.  If you like sriracha-type spicy mixed with super sweet, it may be for you! He did however say the wings were cooked perfectly and he can see why they're popular here - he could see himself coming here with some guy friends to watch a game and eat a bunch of chicken wings and beer! \n\nI got a side salad with ranch & it was quite small but the vegetables were fresh and the dressing was yummy.\n\nWe got the white pizza with sliced tomatoes on top as our entree. After hearing rave reviews and seeing them in the newspaper for great pizza, I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The pizza was good, just not that flavorful at all. We couldn't taste any real garlic or salt in the oil or on top. The crust itself was DELICIOUS though!\n\nI also did not like that we kept getting new paper plates and plastic condiment cups for every single thing. It just seems super wasteful to me! \n\nI could see us coming back to Caliente for another birthday meal or something like that. \n\nHowever, it definitely is not our vibe for a date night or takeout option, and we just weren't super impressed with the food.\n"}, {"author": "Derek P.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-09-07", "description": "One of my favorite places to go for a beer and pizza.

The dough was my favorite part. Following the trend for square thicker pizza,the dough which is proofed for 5 days was the winner for me.

I throw up the entire rest of the evening. I throw up the entire next day afterwards. After 24 hours of constant nausea, I am able to keep water down, and eventually some ginger ale.

I work downtown and used to hit up the lunch buffet when I felt like eating out. This place used to always have amazing food, variance in the buffet options, friendly staff who knew their regulars, and all offered at a great price. \n\nHowever, I went back today for the first time in a few months and was severely disappointed. Caught of guard as the food tasted different (worse) and the ambiance had changed, I learned that ownership changed hands this month. It's clear that they've changed the recipes and completely turned the staff over. Mushy rice, curry that tastes off, and a lack of clean table service will make this a no-go for me moving forward. While they've kept the lunch buffet price the same, they seem to only care about getting people in and out. Sad to see the quality and care change. My advice: try a different Indian restaurant before settling on this one. There are plenty of others with better quality food than this!\n"}, {"author": "Shrikant K.", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2019-06-29", "description": "Took them almost an hour for 4 parathas - which were tasteless and pathetic.

Apparently there was a new owner the day I arrived.  Normally when someone takes over a restaurant they train their staff, develop systems, hire staff. Not here.   It would have been smart of the owner to stay closed upon taking ownership until they could develop some proper restaurant procedures and train staff or just do deliver service only that day.  It was apparent that these folks had no idea how to run a restaurant; service and operation of the business was sloppy.   \n\nDinner Service Issues: \n  \n1.  Three customers in restaurant on a Saturday evening, with a seating capacity of 30 or more tables,  yet it took over an hour or more to receive food.  \n\n2.  A group of six or so GrubHub delivery people mingled loudly by the entry door.  It appeared GrubHub delivery and take out was getting priority over the patrons in the restaurant.  It would have been wise to just order through Grubhub versus eat here as my food would have arrived faster. \n\n3.  Waiter was brand new and could not pronounce or was familiar with any of the Indian menu dishes.  Also was bringing out one dish at a time to patrons every 15 minutes or so .  Waiter was also likely serving as the bus boy, sous chef, and food runner and not focusing on customers. He tried .. I don't blame him; I blame whomever was in charge of training or managing him. \n \n4.  The head cook also moonlighted as a food runner and online order taker; constantly running in/out of the restaurant or chasing after GrubHub delivery people who took the wrong bags. \n\n5.  The owner was just standing behind the cash machine/counter the entire time not assisting employees or the operation of the business.  He was more focused on organizing take out orders for the grubhub delivery people (which any lower level employee could do).   Perhaps he should have been back in the kitchen assisting his staff and hire someone else in charge of host/check out/Grubhub order taking duties.   \n\n6.  Decor, tables and environment of restaurant seemed rather drab/beat up.  Upon closer look tables were not properly cleaned off as the waiter was too busy doing five or six other job titles . \n\n\nOn a positive the food was OK  without viewing what in the heck was going on back in the kitchen.  The presentation of it could have been a little better.   People familiar with this restaurant  mentioned the lunch buffet is a little more organized as it is a buffet/requires no waiting service.   The waiter and owner did apologize for the sloppy service and appeared they were well aware that there were some problems they need to address at this location.  A discount at checkout would have been a nice gesture.  My advice regarding dinner service if eating here- maybe wait a month or so to eat dinner here on site after my review posts  until they develop some restaurant systems/procedures/know how to run a restaurant or just order for takeout only as your order will come faster.\n"}, {"author": "Paul P.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2018-02-27", "description": "Came here in the evening prior to a symphony performance - it's just down the street from Heinz Hall.\nIt was...okay.

I used to eat at the lunch buffet frequently under prior ownership. However, I was completely underwhelmed at my last visit. I never expect much spice in an Indian lunch buffet given the need to cater to all tastes, but the food just lacks flavor. The chana masala tasted like plain boiled chick peas, the dal makhani nearly had no flavor, the chicken tikka masala didn't have a rich flavor, etc. I could go on but you get the point. Prior owner had a very kind, courteous woman at the front desk who would greet you with a friendly smile and was always very helpful. When I got takeout, she would give me plenty of naan and a side of tamarind sauce each time.

Nothing out of this world spectacular but nothing that was terrible. The chicken was good and so was the veggie options. I will say that the tikka masala chicken was a little dry, which is hard to do, I think, for something that is marinated in a heavy sauce. But the sauce was also a bit watered down.

But I feel I need to warn you. Unfortunately, this is the worst pizza place I've been to in Pittsburgh, and I've been to most. It also competes for the worst food I've had in Pittsburgh. Let me start off by telling you about the experience. \n\nFirst, online ordering is completely useless. I wasted about 20 minutes trying to enter my order into both Yelp and GrubHub and neither worked properly. I would try to clip the \"free breadsticks when spending $25\" coupon after adding $25 worth of food to my cart and instead of working it would just delete my pizza from my cart and say \"Oops! Looks like you haven't spent $25 yet!\" So I tried GrubHub. We decided to get the 'Family Feast' - Pizza, breadsticks, a sub, a drink for $25ish.  When choosing the 1 topping pizza we noticed there's no option to make it only half pepperoni. Fine. We'll just make the whole thing pepperoni. But when you go to add 1 topping to your 1 topping pizza it charges you $1.75 for an 'extra topping'! I guess the one topping they give you for free is just the cheese. Fine. I'll pay $1.75 for pepperoni. Now to choose a sub - my wife wanted buffalo chicken. As you might expect, you can customize it a bit, but there is one section in particular where you can add extra toppings, like gyro meat or crab meat. We thought about it, then decided not to add crab meat...but it doesn't let you. It's a required field! You have to pay extra to add some extra topping or you can't add it. When I went back to check the pizza section I noticed it's the same thing - you are forced to pay extra for a topping - even the one that's included! And there is no way to just choose cheese pizza with no extra topping. \n\nSo I called instead. That experience was great! I decided to add $5 cheese fries to our Family Feast. Food was done pretty quick and they gave us everything we ordered. Unfortunately. The most damning thing about Pesaro's is the taste of the food. \n\nThe breadsticks are bland, the sub might have been edible but did they didn't put any buffalo sauce on the buffalo sub. The ranch is just packets. The pizza tastes like what I remember next-day Chuck E Cheese pizza tasting like. And that wasn't even the worst. Literally, what are those cheese fries? Why are they charging $5 for those? The fries are uncooked. The cheese is just a giant glob of some bland cheese that cements the raw fries to the foil. It was impossible to eat and if there is one thing I'm thankful for it's that. I threw them right away. To be fair, it wasn't all bad - the highlight of our meal was the 2 liter of Pepsi. \n\nIt's often true that you can spend a small amount of money to get a lot of trash (Dominos), or spend more money to get a little gold (Spak). Pesaro's is like spending a lot of money on a little bit of trash.\nHow does this place exist on Butler street?\n"}, {"author": "Anonymous W.", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2018-08-13", "description": "Worst fries I have ever had from a pizza place.... chicken tenders were skimpy af..... overall place was total garb\n"}, {"author": "Terence G.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2018-08-02", "description": "We're Quasi-Regulars delivery is timely, food is average.

(Ahhhh yeah, mmmmmmm, but we do, because we love their xtra cheese pizza w the thick fresh cheese layer, oh. my. yum. ) Fresh toppings. \n\nI am going to be honest- Personally, Pesaro's Pizza is tied w Caliente's as my favorite local places to get pizza.  There are many similarities. Quality. Both use fresh, quality cheese and toppings. Both serve dough that's handled properly before it's even cooked and it can be tasted in the product when eaten. \n\n\nHowever there are some huge differences. To start, price. Pisaro's is about 12 and some change for the xl. About ten less than my other favorite place. Pesaro's pizza size is also noticeably much, much bigger. We can order one xl and feed the entire family w a few slices leftover. Our other favorite place requires us to buy at least two of their xl size pizzas to equal one of Pesaro's.\n\nPesaro's Pizza pick up xl one topping pizza special is amazing. $12.84 is a fantastic deal!\n"}, {"author": "Karla D.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2016-06-05", "description": "When it's Sunday morning at 1030 am and you want pizza badly...call these guys!

But it's really not a pleasant shop to walk into. The staff are always disorganized; often they're bickering or complaining about their day. I've noticed that it takes them a while to locate my order as well, especially if I place it through GrubHub. And it typically feels like there aren't enough people to make the orders, answer the phone, and interact with customers at the front counter. Just a high stress, grouchy environment all around.\n\nMeanwhile, the food varies in quality. Their pizza is good, as are their french fries. The main appeal of the hoagies is more that you get a lot of food for a fairly low price; otherwise, they're pretty \"meh\". It's also a bummer that when ordering through GrubHub, you're limited to ordering regular or diet Coke. They have other drinks available in-store! They're just...not available to app users. Sigh.\n\nMy final vote for this place is 3.5 stars; they're a cheap lunch option, the affordability is a plus, and some food items are better than others.

(I suggest making reservations a few days in advance.) I'm glad that I did and will certainly be returning in the future.\n\nUpon our arrival, we were warmly greeted by the bartender and waited just a few minutes to be seated.  The wine list is pretty extensive and surprisingly affordable for such a small restaurant. We ordered the pear and baked Brie for an appetizer and it was oh-my-god yummy. The Brie was gooey and runny and warm, which is just how it should be! Our meals included starter salads, which were pleasant. (Note: Try the limoncello dressing if you have a chance. It's light, yet flavorful.) The main dishes were really good, as well. Hubby had the pasta aioli and I had the shrimp San Marco. \n\nThe reason that I rate my experience at the Caffe as 4 stars, instead of 5, is two-fold: first, our server was overwhelmed by a large party and several others tables. We waited a pretty long time to ask for refills, etc.  Second, the menu, while delicious, is pretty limited to pastas and a few meat dishes.  There are only a couple fish and poultry options and most of them are pasta based.\n\nOverall, a nice dinner and charming restaurant that I'll recommend to friends and family.\n"}, {"author": "Robin R.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2017-08-08", "description": "Gran Canal is a true hidden gem.

I've liked Nepalese food for years, but don't see many around. So I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem.  I had a mutton thaali, with a mango lasso. All of it was great. The thaali came with pulse soup, mutton, vegetable curry, basmati rice, papadon, yogurt, and gulab jomun for dessert. \n\nAll of this with a friendly atmosphere, and good service.\n"}, {"author": "F P.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2019-10-04", "description": "I came in here twice over a one week period. Tried a few different things because I'm somewhat unfamiliar with the food.\n\nBoth times the service was the same. Not anything spectacular but the waiter dude was nice and both times the cook came out and asked us if the food was good. They were pleasant and there is a slight language barrier but not a big deal (I'm the one that doesn't speak their language, after all). The only real complaint here is the water they give you doesn't have ice cubes in it. But besides that, no real complaints about the service.\n\nFirst time I came in and got the Samosa Chat and Chicken Chau Chau. Samosas are what I would say the Himalayan version of an Egg Roll. Potatoes, carrots, peas mashed up inside an egg roll wrapper with curry spices and deep fried. Samosa Chat means they put plain yogurt and some veggies and chickpeas on it. Its surprisingly filling and delicious. The yogurt has a sour cream-esque thing going on. Quite nice. The Chau Chau is basically not much more than a pack of Ramen Noodles all doctored up with a few veggies and some pieces of Chicken. I was disappointed with this and wouldn't get it again.\n\nSecond time I came in with my SO. We got the Veggie Appetizer Plattter, Veggie Chow Mein and Chicken Pikora. The Appetizer Platter was good. You get a variety of yummy deep fried things. A samosa, some momos (veggie wontons), onion pakora (their version of onion rings/bloomin' onion), aloo pakora (deep fried curry potato patty). Everything was hot, flavorful, fresh and crispy. I asked for everything to be made \"Spicy AF\" and, sadly, the heat was not amped up. They did give me a little dish of mashed up red chilis. It added some warmth but not as much as I'd like.\n\nVeggie Chow Mein was great. My SO liked this the most. Sort of like what you would get at a Chinese spot just with South Asian spices (Curry). The serving size was a bit small but this was a great, tasty dish.\n\nChicken Pikora was basically their version of Chicken Nuggets. The batter was quite delicious. The dipping sauce was tasty though not spicy-hot. But I liked this one most of all the stuff we got.\n\nSecond time I went, we got some bottled Coke and didn't touch our water.

The thukpa was slightly lacking in mutton. That said the pork soup and curry were loaded with meat so they may have just been low on mutton. The momo portion was fine.

Let me start by saying the food isn't terrible.   I always order a lot so I can compare the taste of other places I have been. Maybe I didn't go at the right time, but all of our main courses were cold and the rice was over cooked. I actually coughed when I ate my first spoonful of chicken curry, it was the saltiest curry I have ever had.. The chicken was cooked well, I liked it but it was destroyed with salt. I also had a Chili Mo Mo, I took this at a very high heat, an 8. However, the dumplings in the Chili Mo Mo are fried, so I expected them to have a tougher outer shell. However, we also ordered a Steamed Pork Mo Mo and the dumplings were clearly not fresh. They were cool and the pastry was very hard, its like what I would expect when they were frozen or refrigerated for a long time or not cooked properly.. The Vegetable platter appetizer I enjoyed. I had worked up a 40 dollar tab but wished I didn't have to pay it because I wasn't satisfied with the food quality at all. I will stick with the other Nepalese restaurant just down the road.

Sadly this once stand up dining experience  has hit the proverbial iceberg. I won't write poorly about the wait staff only because they know how bad this place is and they're just doing their job. The food is old and not fresh. I had the cup of clam chowder and it was fair, as was the sourdough bread, but honestly these items I'm sure were premade elsewhere. I had fresh oysters 3 of which I regret eating, thinking well the next one will be better. They ran the brine from them and were not cut properly from the shell. I had the beer battered (Sam Adam's) shrimp, same thing, the next one will be better, I ate 2. (This was the Long John Silver's I was referring to) and if anybody knows that experience it comes back around on you. So gross, wasn't even remotely sea worthy tasting. Such regret.\n\nMy husband had french fries and although those managed to be tasty, his stir fried vegetables were edible however tasteless. He is a vegetarian and there were not many options and he got burned and I feel bad I dragged my family there. My poor son just ordered a caesar salad, how can they screw up a salad? well they managed it. Sadly strewn about a dinner plate looking more like a garnish for a Christmas Ham, sliding off the plate with every fork stabbing attempt, mushy crouton mixed with hard over toasted ones. \n\nJust a sad day at Mitchell's, years ago it was a favorite.  Despite the manager comping the check, I let him know that we will never come back to this establishment again. Its simply overpriced delivering less than fast food quality.

I decided to eat at the bar. I ordered the Cabernet and ahi tuna from the happy hour special. While delicious, I thought the ahi tuna was small (super thin slices), even for a reduced price of $10. The Cabernet was a very excellent choice at $6. My biggest complaint (besides the price/portion) was the service. I felt like there was no attention made to me after I ordered my food. A prime example was that I had to ask for a water refill, after having it be empty for several minutes. And when I asked for the check, the bartender was a little snotty telling me it was already folded up in a glass near where I sat.

We decided that we would go on a quiet Sunday afternoon and wrap ourselves up in a seafood cocoon.  The d\u00e9cor of the place is your basic upscale \"seafood shanty\" style.  Brass accents and hardwood floors, you know this type of place.\n\nSince we had reservations, we were seated quickly.  My sister had never been to the restaurant before and I haven't been there in quite some time.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful in assisting us with making our selections.  When it comes to seafood, I'll eat almost anything and I wanted something yummy.  My sister, on the other hand is extremely picky.  Since we were starving, we both decided to order appetizers.  My sister ordered the \"Spicy Crispy Shrimp\" (Shrimp with creamy chili glaze, sticky rice and pickled cucumbers) and I ordered the \"Maryland Style Crab Cake\" served with roasted corn, tabasco mash remoulade and traditional tartar\".  We also received a warm loaf of sourdough bread and butter.  Ahhhh, I love warm bread and butter. (I hate the fact that a lot of restaurants charge extra for this accompaniment, but I'm still a sucker for warm bread.)  The Spicy Crispy Shrimp were a gentler version of another restaurant's \"Bang-Bang Shrimp\" dish.  The sauce leaned more creamy than spicy and the tempura batter was a little thicker that I like, but it was a decent dish.  The Maryland Style Crab Cake on the other hand was entirely too salty.  I like crab cakes that are composed mainly of crab meat with just enough of a binder to hold the thing together.  The crab cake passed that test but failed on the seasoning test.  It was so salty that it actually distracted from the rest of my meal. Bleh!\n\nFor our entrees, my sister ordered Chili Glazed Salmon with asparagus and I ordered the dinner Prix Fixe meal with Lobster Bisque, Triple Shrimp and Banana Bread Pudding as my dessert. (I know that I ordered a lot of food, but didn't I say from the start that we were starving?)  My sister's salmon was perfectly cooked as well as the asparagus.  The tempura shrimp that were a part of my Triple Shrimp entr\u00e9e, were light and not greasy. (That's why I don't usually order tempura shrimp)  Additionally, the bacon wrapped shrimp portion was also tasty.  My Triple Shrimp was served with a side of jambalaya rice and veggies.  Both were okay. (I'm a little spoiled when it comes to rice.  I like to see individual grains, but the dish had a good flavor.)\n\nOverall, we were pleased with our meals (except the crabcake).

They were disgusting and flavorless. Bacon wrapped bbq shrimp was a little better not much. The entrees were terrible as well my son had salmon. He said it was flavorless. But the kicker was $44 for the smallest portion ever of Alaskan King Crab Legs. They can't even serve with proper drawn butter. I ordered hollandaise for the asparagus and it was cold. Despite this we ordered dessert. We had the Sharkfin pie. It would have been good except it was freezer burned and the bottom layer was hard as a rock. This place is so awful. \nService was ok. I guess there were guests at the booth in front of us that the staff knew so they were constantly hovering around that table with the hostess even sitting down with the guests during her shift. Even the manager was hovering around the table. That was pretty annoying. Red Lobster is better and cheaper.

She has been to Mitchells several times and speaks highly about it.  I have been there before but is has been several years and really didn't recall much.  But like my friend I love seafood so there was no objections there.\n\nThe menu isn't too big, which is good, and they allow you to choose sides vs giving you what they deem you should have with your meal.  Our waitress was very nice. We arrived a little after my friend, but waited about 15 minutes for her other friend and date to show.  Once settled in we all placed our orders.\n\nI decided on a yellowfin tuna, prepared medium rare, and for the sides I requested a double order of asparagus.  We didn't wait too long for our 6 meals to arrive.  However, 3 out of 6 of those contained mistakes.  My BFF asked for coleslaw.  Not there.  Easy fix they brought it out.  My husband wanted fries, he got potatoes.  Ok so now he gets both for same price, so I guess another easy fix.  And then there was me.  They just straight up brought me someone else's food.  The waitress quickly grabbed it up after I said to the guy this isn't what I ordered.  There was rice on the plate, and I don't know what fish since it only sat in front of me for a few seconds before being snatched away.  I only waited a few minutes and she brought me my correct meal.\n\nThe yellowfin looked amazing.  Nice thick portion, and once I cut into it, it was beautifully cooked and seasoned well.  However, my \"double\" order of asparagus was FIVE spears.  Before the waitress left after bringing the correct order I said something to her about it.  That to which she said, \"That is a double\".  Hmmm.  So a single order is 2 and  1/2 pieces of asparagus right?  That's bunk.  My fellow diners felt sorry for me and offered up some of their veggies, very sweet of them.  Weird thing was, my friend's other friends date ordered asparagus as one of his sides and got 4 pieces.  So was it just me or maybe they need some help executing in the kitchen and in service.  Not to mention the meal was $32.00, and I just bought a bundle of asparagus for 1.88 at the Giant Eagle!  \n\nSo other than the mix-ups and the asparagus situation of 2016, I really enjoyed my meal and time at Mitchells.

Mitchell's used to have a great menu and I've always been thrilled with my selections.  I don't know what changed, but it was something.  I ordered the crispy ginger salmon with stir fried vegetables.   The portion was ample, but the fish was sort of mushy and the crispy ginger topping wasn't crispy at all.

My boyfriend loved it, I wasn't so sure how I liked it however, it wasn't bad, but the sauce wasn't wowing me, it was still enjoyable however. What really disappointed me was the last item I ordered, which was the fettuccine Alfredo. Anyone who knows me knows I LOVE pasta, especially a simple cheesy Alfredo. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to try all their pasta dishes, but I always stick with simple when trying somewhere new, because if the simple things aren't good, chances are the other menu items aren't. The Fettuccine Alfredo from La Felice was quite disappointing. The sauce was definitely artificial tasting, and not homemade. The fettuccine was very over cooked and was not al dent\u00e8 whatsoever. The meal came with a side salad and a piece of garlic bread. The garlic bread was quite good, but the salad was kind of boring. The lettuce was definitely fresh, but it was cut so unevenly.

I don't know where they were getting their ingredients, but my guess is out of a box from the biggest chain store in the world (no free ads) instead of Italy. If it is almost midnight after some hippie concert or after a Stiller game where Big Ben and Jeff Reed plan to flirt with some women afterwards; then, get this pizza. If that isn't the case with how your night is going, don't.\n"}, {"author": "Mike M.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2018-01-15", "description": "Got an XL pizza from here: half hawaiian and half pepperoni.

I have tried out quite a few Pittsburgh Thai restaurant where they would order the Panang curry and this one is their favorite. So I tried it as well.

I got the Pad Se Ew and my wife got the Spicy Rice Noodles.  We also ordered their Fresh Spring Rolls for an appetizer.\n\n     The restaurant is nothing fancy just average decorations and furniture.  Our waiter was nice.  The menu wasn't too big either but it had what we were looking for.

My wife thought they needed to have more mint and green things in the rolls (LOL) but it's actually just how I like it.  Their peanut sauce was a little sweet and we heard another customer complain about it.  The hot Thai sauce that we asked for was really good and went well with our rolls.  \n\n     Our food came out and there was a lot of food on the plate.  I asked for chicken and it was good.

We were at the Waterworks Mall whenever we became hungry and so thought that the Thai Place would be the perfect lunch spot for us.  We arrived to the restaurant at around 11:30 to find the place completely empty.  That certainly didn't seem good but we reasoned that it was still early.  During the entirety of our meal only a single other table ended up walking in.  Anyways the inside of the Thai Place consists of an almost comically small bar where the cash register is and then a rather large dining room.  We were given our choice of seats and my wife chose a booth near the back of the restaurant.\n\nFor my lunch entree on this day I wasn't able to find anything interesting which I was familiar with on the lunch menu and so I ended up trying something different.  So I ordered the Khao Man Gai while my wife went with the pad Thai from the regular menu.  The menu described my Khao Man Gai as tender juicy chicken, fragrant ginger and garlic flavored rice, served with a light chili dipping sauce.  However my request for a spice level 10 meant that the dipping sauce would be quite spicy.   I have to admit that whenever my dish came to the table that I was quite disappointed with how it looked.  The chicken was cooked plain and was sitting next to a white looking rice and a chili dipping sauce.  My first bite of the chicken plain didn't really help the matter as I found it was somewhat boring.  However the next bite I dipped in the sauce and man was that spicy and flavorful!  I proceeded to dip the rest of the chicken into the sauce and enjoy every bite of it.  Once I had finished the chicken I planned on eating maybe a 1/4 to 1/2 of the rice like I usually do.  However that garlic and ginger flavor that was in it was nice and I ended up eating all of it.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While I didn't really expect much from this restaurant and food, especially after I first saw it, the food ended up being sneaky good and I really enjoyed my lunch here.\n"}, {"author": "Lindsay B.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-04-28", "description": "Delightful family style Thai food within walking distance of the Waterworks Mall. It's a little difficult to get to on foot-- although there are crosswalks close to the restaurant, there is no easy sidewalk path so you'll be wandering a bit through grass and rocks. Despite the slight inconvenience, however, the breadth of the menu and flavoring is an absolute delight. \n\nI ordered Mongolian beef (spice level 8 on a 0-10 scale) for around $14. As someone who enjoys spicy food a lot, a spice level of 8 was very mild. Next time I'll definitely order a spice level 10 to get a bit more kick. The dish was quite hefty-- I came home with leftovers for dinner the next night, so it's well worth the price!

They cook to order so your food is fresh and isn't sitting out under a heat lamp.  My friend says the hot and sour soup here is the best she's tasted as well.  I like their pork egg roll but it is pretty different from others.  It is mainly vegetable (Cabbage I believe) and pork.  Their egg drop soup is pretty decent.\n\nI can't say I am impressed with their other dishes.  I've had curry chicken, shrimp fried rice, chicken soup, shrimp egg roll.  They were definitely edible just no where near as flavorful as the beef lo mien.  The chicken soup was horrible.  It was bland and the noodles were lo mien noodles.  Fried rice were ok but I've had much much better at other places.  They have a huge menu though so it'll take some time to go through them.\n\nThe obvious bad thing about this place is it is in a ghetto neighborhood.    It is probably not worth making a trip out there but if you're in the neighborhood, I'd say give it a try.  They're cheap and they give you tons of food.

I was going to get tacos but that didn't work out. So decided I would try for a gyro. When I showed up to said gyro place I found Tender instead. There is a menu posted in the window so I took a look and thought I would try a sandwich. There is kind of 2 menues to this place. One is the chicken side and the other is the Cuban sandwich side. It almost feels like ordering off of a secret menu but it's not. \n\nUpon entering I found a few small tables set up and an ordering counter. I asked the girl what was good. She responded with what are you in the mood for and gave a bit of a list. I said a sandwich. Her response was the Cuban or the Bay Of Pigs if you like spicy. I said I like spicy let's go with the Bay Of Pigs and got a side of fries as well. \n\nIt took ten min for my food to come out. While waiting I found out they are about a month old and have no pics tips or reviews on here so of course I was going to remedy that. The girl behind the counter brought me out my food and I have to say my sandwich was much larger then I had expected. I enjoyed the sandwich. The meats were flavorful and the cheese added a much needed contrast to the spice of the meats and the sauce.  I also enjoyed the fries. They were the generic store bought kind but they were fresh and crispy and not overly salted. \n\nI had also heard the girl at the counter say there was additional seating up stairs. So once I was done with my food I went up to check it out. Now I must say the stairs are a bit iffy so watch your step and be careful when you come down. That first step is larger then it looks. The upstairs space is nice. It even has a water dispenser and cups set up. Along with a table of condiments. Basically I wish I would have headed up stairs to eat but no big deal.

After much debate with coworkers where we should get food from, a yelp search and some stomach grumbling, we decided on this place.  None of use had heard of this place before, but sometimes that is a good thing such is the case for here.\n\nAfter looking over the menu we each decided on our choices, I opted for the six piece meal that came with two sides and two sauces for no other reason than I was being greedy that day.  These are not your typical tenders, they are actually better if I may say so myself.  Longer than most tenders you come across when you go elsewhere.  I really think they should have called this place Strips...wait, that would sound bad and make this place sound like a whole different type of establishment than it is.  Breaded and seasoned perfectly and the right size to be able to dip all the way to the end, no need to tear them apart.  The sides were equally satisfying.  I decided, since I was being greedy, to get a double side of tater tots.  I am not sure what it is about tater tots, but I am obsessed with them.  That's why this place was surprisingly filling.  I only opted for the barbeque sauce for my dipping.  Each order also comes with you generic piece of Texas garlic toast.\n\nNow, asides from parking, here is the downside.  If you are choosing to eat in, make sure you are only dining with one other person or alone.  The inside of this place is rather small, with only about three or four two seater tables for dining in.

Having tried and enjoyed the Cuban sandwich at Black Bean, I was eager to try one of the Cuban dinners from this new establishment run by the same owners.\n\nSeeing an unfamiliar dish listed as picadillo on the menu, I asked the woman working what it was, and she told me it was seasoned pork.  It sounded interesting to me, so I decided to order the meal version of it ($9.99), and CM went with the fried fish dinner ($9.99).  However, when the dish was brought to me, the meat turned out to be ground beef, which is the epitome of meats that I won't touch with a ten foot pole.  I told the woman who had taken my order, who brought our meals to us, that I don't eat beef, and she looked mortified.  I asked her if she could bring me some of the roast pork instead, and she eagerly did so free of charge.  I just wish she would have checked with me about picadillo being beef-based instead of pork-based, which would have prevented it from being wasted (CM tried it, but wasn't a fan, so that's unfortunately what happened).\n\nEach of the meals came with rice and beans, fried plantains, and some kind of buttered toast, plus the entree that we'd ordered--a decent amount of food for the money.  The pork was of the pulled variety, and was okay, but parts of it were too fatty and dried out to eat, and I found it underseasoned.  (Not sure if the version I received is how it's typically served on a platter, since it was a last-minute substitution.)  The addition of some hot sauce helped to add some flavor.  I tried a bite of CM's fish, and thought it was better than the pork.  As for the sides, we both really enjoyed the toast. Incidentally, neither of us are huge fans of plantains (we don't like sweet foods as part of a meal--as opposed to for dessert), but we tried them, and they were good.  The rice and beans was nothing special--just a scoop of white rice with some black beans on top--and were also underseasoned, such that I added salt and pepper to them, which helped.\n\nMy favorite part of the meal, by far, was the fried cookie dough that we ordered for dessert ($3.99).  Having checked out the photos prior to coming, I saw photos of it and decided that I wanted to try it, and CM obliged, sharing it with me.  It consisted of three large balls about 4\" in diameter, ideal for splitting between 2-3 people.  If you've never tried fried cookie dough before, like me, it's amazing!  It was fried long enough to produce a crispy exterior and a cooked rind, while the interior stayed delightfully warm and gooey.  Fried Oreos and candy bars are also available for dessert as well.\n\nOverall, we were pleased with our quick dinner at Tenders.  While I found my meal somewhat inconsistent in quality, I suspect that if I ordered something else, such as the chicken or fish, or a sandwich, it would have been more consistent.  I'll have to visit another time for lunch to see if they can earn a fourth star--though I'm tempted to up the rating based on the fried cookie dough alone, which I may also be back for soon!  3.5 stars.\n"}, {"author": "Erin B.", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2017-04-05", "description": "Pretty terrible.

It took a while for our drinks to come, my friend's was the wrong one and we had to ask about my friend's beer 2 times before she told us they were out and another would have to be ordered. We also had to ask for bread to be brought to our table. The food took what felt like forever too. The manager did come in to give an update of our meals and apologize. Then came us trying to pay our check. I would estimate it look 15min for her to come back and swipe the card. Overall a good place for food with many menu options, but could use more employees to cover the Friday rush so it wasn't a 3hr process.\n"}, {"author": "Eva R.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2018-06-08", "description": "Bravo's has been a staple in the Galleria as long as I can remember!

We were seated at a nice table by the window up front so we thought. There was a party in a private room next to us and a very large party in a partitioned part of the dining room. Well Bravo limited their access to the dining room by blocking an entrance with tables. The only access for this party of 60 was through the private room and squeezing past our table. At first I was very cordial and cooperative. After we had to ask for several condiments and forgetting our soups it became a hassle. I was paying for my dinner just like the large party. Waitresses and busboys were squeezing around us by the tens. No less than 40 people crossed our paths. I was surprised the Fire Marshall would  approve the limited exit paths. The final straw was a hostess with extremely long hair down past her butt flinging past through the narrow access and her hair wishing though my pasta. We told her she needed to put her hair up...she replied that since she was a hostess and not a server...she wasn't required to comply with the same requirements as the servers. She then informed me \" you will have to stand and move so another large party could get to their table\". Not a please will you stand so we may seat? More of a move your ass. Food was just edible...I know it's a chain so I didn't expect much. The Shrimp Alfredo was lacking all flavor. Again I realize they were busy that night but you need to service people to keep up with standards.

We weren't looking for an Irish meal to partake in, we just wanted food.  We were pleasantly surprised when we showed up here and found out that the days special were all Irish meals.  You could choose from Shepherd's pie, bangers and mash and for the life I me I cannot remember the other.\n\nBefore I get any further into the food let me do a little run down of the place.  Tavern In the Wall is an apt description of this place.  Most people wouldn't not look twice at this place as it fits into the street wall in Aspinwall.  From the outside it doesn't look like much.  When you walk inside it is vibrant.  Appears to be the place to be for locals as most people at the bar talked to all the employees in here.  Staff were pleasant for the most part (I caught a little vibe from one of the workers that we might have been infringing on something in here, but we were here to do one thing, eat).\n\nOur server greeted us promptly after we seated ourselves.  Not being here before we were not sure whether to wait to be seated or do it ourselves.  There is no indication what to do here.  We parked ourselves in a booth and the server had menus in our hands and drink orders placed.  We looked over the menu while we waited for our drinks and kind of decided what we wanted.  When our server came back she told us of the specials for the day.  With that we forgot about our menus and both ordered the Shepherd's pie.  This came with your choice of soup or salad.  I opted for the salad which was an impressive mix of greens, vegetables and some amazing croutons that I suspect were made in house.  Great start to the meal.\n\nThe Shepherd's pie then arrived.  At first glance I was a bit disappointed thinking that there needed to be more mashed potatoes on top.  But once I started into that piping hot boat of lamb I was persuaded that the potato ratio was the correct amount.  This special really did hit the spot and made for a great Irish meal on an Irish day.  Maybe next time we are here we will venture into the menu.

After looking at the menu, it seemed like a safe choice, not to mention, after having spent a full day at the zoo, I was in desperate need of a beer.  I simply figured it was a win-win.\n\nThat feeling was quickly derailed.  As appetizers we ordered the pretzel sticks and the buffalo chicken dip.  Buffalo chicken dip was good in flavor, but could use more chicken in the dip.  The pretzels were definitely reheated and lacked the traditional crisp coating a homemade pretzel brings.  The tavern burger I ordered had an over cooked egg and had no runny goodness, smoked Gouda cheese and and over cooked meat patty that lacked flavor and seemed to be from a frozen patty pack.  Homemade chips were ok.   The philly cheese steak was also just ok.  The wings were actually pretty decent, I simply prefer them crunchier, but I do enjoy they brought out the whole wing as it should be.  \n\nI did enjoy their Honey Blossom Hefe beer A LOT and was glad that I had a tasty winner the first try.  Also, I can speak for the customer service very highly.  This is why i gave 3 instead.  Quite attentive and willing to work with the demands a large group brings.

For reference, the high-end Joseph Tambellini restaurant across the bridge in Highland Park charges $9 for fried zucchini. $17 for pasta with sauce? Again, just to put that in perspective, Girasole in Shadyside charges $13. Based on the \"bar quality\" of The Tavern's food, their prices definitely need to come down to Earth and be more in line with the type of food they serve....either that, or they need to up their game quality-wise and change their bar vibe to more of a nice restaurant vibe to justify the price.  \n\nSo, in sum, if you're looking for a good local watering hole where you can catch a drink, definitely give Tavern in the Wall a try...but if all you're in the market for is a great dinner, I'd look elsewhere.\n"}, {"author": "Karin M.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2017-02-10", "description": "Met friends here for a late lunch.

It is something I always loved and in my adult live still make it from time to time especially during football season. Having recently moved to Pittsburgh, one of the first things I made was Isaly's Chipped Ham BBQ Sandwiches for myself and a friend who moved here from New York who had never had it before. She loved it by the way!  \n\nSo how surprised was I when I made a routine trip to the Dollar Store and looked across the street to see an Isaly's Diner!?  Unfortunately on that day it was closed because it was after 2pm. Take note of that, the hours are 7a-2p daily.  Now I only knew them for their ham but the diner front seemed to really push their breakfast so I decided that Sunday to head down and see what it was all about. Turns out that was one of the best decisions I've made recently!  As soon as you walk in you are sort of transported to a simpler time. There are some booths along the wall and then an actually counter to sit at. I picked the counter and was promptly greeted by the waitress. I told her I had just moved and was out exploring so she gave me a bit of history and as it turns out this is one of only three locations still in operation. They had a daily special and the waitress suggested the pancakes and to come back for a milkshake sometime. I wanted to do a traditional breakfast so I went with the Everyday Special which has 2 eggs any style, Sausage or Bacon, Home Fries and Toast for $6.49.  I went for over easy with sausage and Texas Toast. My food was prepared just down the counter where I could see and took only a few minutes. It was cooked to perfection! The eggs whites were cooked but the yolks remained \"dippy\" for my toast. The Home Fries had a nice crispy outside but soft inside. A little bit of Frank's really pushed them over the edge. The sausage links and Texas Toast with butter topped it all off.  Simple is sometimes better.  I will definitely come back to try the pancakes but it will be hard to pass this again.\n\nThe diner itself has pictures of yesteryear from the old West View Park along with some other local flare. There was a Newspaper on the counter to read if I wanted and they had the local news on the TV. My waitress was great. Very attentive and friendly. Plus she took the time to talk with me about the history surrounding Isaly's. She really made you feel welcome. I was there around 8:30a and left at about 9. When I arrived it was myself and maybe 2 other tables but as I was leaving it was starting to get busier. Another waitress had come in and I imagine the Church crowd was arriving.  Also as I was leaving I realized that they have a deli up front where you can get the famous ham along with various other cold cuts and the BBQ sauce. There is a cooler with a few beverages to go and a small gift shop area with shirts and small knickknacks.\n\nI need to make it back to try lunch and grab a milk shake!

Isaly's has a classic diner feel and the staff is very welcoming.  One of my friends was looking over a list of breakfast places I had created. (i.e. a spreadsheet that included the names of places, their location and any helpful hints or recommendations.  This spreadsheet was created as part of my New Year's resolution to try different locally owned breakfast spots.)  Our waitress/one of the owners told us she and her husband (our cook/the other owner) do the same thing, but she was impressed with my list because they \"just write things down.\"  She also complimented me on my shirt and asked me where I bought it (online at LOL Mart).  It has a drawing of a sunny side up egg and a strip of bacon holding hands and underneath it says \"BFF\" - and it has become my designated breakfast shirt.  The owners were very friendly and accomodating, engaging us in conversation during our meal about other breakfast spots in the the Pittsburgh area.  They joked about how we would rate them and our waitress paid special attention to us, perhaps nervous of what we might tell others.  A few other patrons came in, but only for take out orders or to pick up some chipped ham.  \n\nThey bragged about using real butter - one of the few places to do so.  When I got my meal, it was beautiful - the real butter from my bread was dripping onto my bacon.  I think I shed a tear.  I asked how many eggs are in their omelettes because they were pretty big.  The answer I received was, \" We don't know, we just crack and pour!\"  They pride themselves on not measuring anything.  I have no complaints because my food was delicious.  After eating our meals the three of us decided to order the chocolate chip pancakes to share since we had heard so much about them. When the owner brought them over, she had individual plates for each of us with one pancake each.  And the best part?  She told us they were on the house.  \n\nI think we spent close to 2 hours there, which really says something about a place.  Especially when you consider that we had just worked a 12-hour overnight shift and exhaustion was setting in.  It was comfortable and a good time, perhaps the best breakfast experience ever.  We left telling the owners we would pass the word along and that we would definitely return.

Pretty basic fare.  They have your typical subs, pizza, fried apps, wings, some pasta dishes and salads.  I have tried several of their pizzas, specialty and the regular ones.  I have also tried their salads and once got a gyro.  The gyro sucked, straight up sucked.  It was more or less a few pieces of mystery meat in a pita.  Small for the price and the pita was hard.  The salad (only have had the tossed) was very basic.  Iceberg lettuce, some slices of red onion, a cucumber piece and a pepperoncini.  The tomatoes they use are awful, they have never been in season, I throw them away.  But the best part is their Italian dressing.  It is some of the best I have had, and it is (I am told) homemade.  Really, really good.  I would buy bottles of it.\n\nPizza, eh hit and miss.  The buffalo chicken is a favorite at the office.  Spicy but not too much.

The renovation of the Liberty Tunnels forced us to make a detour through Mount Washington. Combing through my memory banks, I was able to recall the name of one of the hilltop neighborhood's mainstay pizzerias: Cestone's. From there, our trusty GPS led us towards shelter and nourishment. \n\nFramed posters of Broadway shows populated the scenery along with cherry-red seats that looked to have been pilfered from a demolished stadium or arena. Amicable, nosy, world-weary regulars loafed about the dining room, dying for someone to conversate with about anything or nothing at all, watching our every movement. So inquisitive were they that I was reluctant to snap photos. The images I did manage to capture were done on the sly. \n\nI started off with a half-hoagie that I would have enjoyed more had there been more meat to chew on. \n\nThe stinginess of that subpar sub was forgotten once our Kay Kombo pizza slid onto our table on a dented grey disc. What I found most striking about this pie was the crust which while crunchy on the very bottom was rather plush in the center. Chewy bits of savory bacon dotted a landscape rendered manna-like by a smooth mozzarella and sweet by a vibrant sauce. While watching the droplets batter the pavement outside from the heavens and listening to the patrons remark on \"that there storm,\" Kay and I quietly dined, thankful that the weather diverted the attention of the \"nebby\" patrons away from us, the people they didn't know. \n\nCestone's (pronounced 'sess-tone's') surprisingly excels at soft serve ice cream, something I thought DiFiore's had a lock on in this part of town. Whether they use a pre-fabricated mix or their own concoction (is whipped topping folded into it?), I haven't any proof, but never before have I had a soft-serve ice cream that came off as so much luscious mousse. Beyond a mere custard, the dairy product fell, slithered into a paper cup, coiling like a vanilla/chocolate serpent. The whipped aerosol foam and microwaved hot fudge were not only immaterial, they were almost in the way. \n\nJust as we paid our check, the downpour halted, and the local folk went back to their lives, watching us leave, nudging each other, pointing to us curiously while we jogged to the Kaymobile, likely asking each other if they recognized us from somewhere.\n\n\"I wonder if that's Elsie's nephew or Donny's boy? You know, the big, bald kid? The cop!\"\n\n\"Oh, I dunno. The girl kinda looked familiar, though.\"\n\nCestone's is one of those Pittsburgh eateries that exists out of time and remains unfazed by trends, renewal, or upheaval. May it stand proudly without giving a crumb over what anyone else thinks of it.\n\nP.S. If it reads like I was slagging the neighborhood people for whom Cestone's is obviously a hangout, I wasn't really. They were actually amusing, harmless, and surely well-meaning. We were both just feeling beaten up from work and weren't much in the mood for chit-chat that evening.\n"}, {"author": "Anil D.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2016-06-04", "description": "Had dinner yesterday at Cestone's Restaurant.

Getting an appetizer is a must, and I usually order the hummus. I'm not a hot sauce fan, but trust me, order some of their hot sauce and add a bit (to taste) to the hummus. It will blow your mind!

I didn't love the flavors or the thin, toasted pita crust and wish I had ordered one of the rolled pitas instead.\n\nService: The first time that my husband and I came here, service was phenomenal. Our food was delivered promptly, and our female waitress (not sure of her name, but she has a very sweet, high voice) was amazing!

The location is directly in the middle of Pitts campus. The scenery was very pleasant and there was a descent amount of seating around the shop. The customer service was not anything special. The wait was not very long. \nI ordered the breakfast burrito but removed the green Chile sauce and added bacon. The bacon was in chewy chunks which I appreciated. The potato's were cut in a home fire style. The burrito at first glance looked pretty small but as I finished it I realized the my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach. I obviously finished it because I know my mom didn't raise a chump. All jokes aside when ordering from here you definitely get your dollars worth.

It literally looks like it came out of a microwaveable meal. I feel bad giving it a review like this but this is my honest opinion. Maybe after some time they'll improve the food and this was just because they're getting use to things but for the quality of food and having to pay ~$8-9 for two small enchiladas with a small portion of rice and beans, this is not worth it. \n\nThe rice looks like it would be seasoned but it was extremely bland.

Called in and an hour later we received our order.\n\nAs we opened it up, he noticed that his Italian Hoagie was just a thin layer of meat on bread. Now, we all know what comes on an Italian Hoagie. He called back and informed them of their mistake and requested a new Hoagie be delivered, they said to him that he would have to return the first Hoagie which he had no problem with seeing as he wasn't going to eat it. \n\nAbout 10 mins later, they called back saying the driver was only going to deliver the vegetables that were supposed to be on it. Unhappily, he accepted it because he was hungry and just wanted to eat. Now 15 minutes after that phone call, my boyfriend called back wondering if he was on his way. They replied that the driver only left 3 minutes ago which was unnerving to say the least.\n\nAs another 5-10 minutes passed, becoming aggravated as the Hoagie was soggy and cold, we called back to ask for a refund because we had become very unhappy at this point, 1hr and 40mins after we initially placed the order from this location. Their response to the refund request was so completely ridiculous, saying they would only refund the vegetables. Now, if you ordered a pizza and it was delivered without cheese, wouldn't it be absolutely ridiculous if not only the shop didn't provide you with a replacement, seeing as it's completely their fault, but told you that they were only going to refund you for the cheese. \n\nI was completely disgruntled, being a manager myself.

At least they were willing to make it right.\n\nThis time, the order was *totally* incorrect and still took over an hour when they are mere blocks from my house.  When I called to get the delivery driver to return, I was told that the driver made a mistake and delivered my food to the wrong location.  Their answer was...seriously...that they were going to send someone out to swap out the food they delivered to me with the food I actually ordered.  This is not only completely unsanitary (I opened the incorrect order and as far as I'm concerned contaminated it even if I didn't actually touch any of it) but at this stage I ordered pretty close to 1.25 hours ago, and  spending further time transporting the food from point A to B and then C is going to mean it's cold and/or soggy.  \n\n15 minutes later, the manager called to ask if I wanted them to re-make the food after I'd already asked for a refund.  This was the proper thing to do the first time, but it was already honestly still too late.  When expecting food in no later than 45 minutes, no one wants to spend close to two hours waiting for a resolution and then wait what could really be another 45 minutes to eat at this hour.\n\nSorry, guys.  Your food is great, but I can't handle it twice in a row.  I might still stop in, but I'm not using you for delivery in the future.\n"}, {"author": "Kathy R.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2018-05-16", "description": "Ordered and paid on Yelp. Very convenient.

I was told about Nana's from a few coworkers and finally had a chance to stop in.\n\nThis place reminds you of a busy department store lunch counter.  It's a pretty narrow spot, but the counter top stretches all the way back.  You have a few choices on how to enjoy your food from here.  The first being that you order and eat in.  The second, show up and order your food to go.  The third, and probably the smartest of them all, call ahead to place your order and show up to pick it up.  I chose the second, probably will do the third on my next venture here.\n\nI don't want to say that I was disappointed by going about my experience the second way because it can be time consuming if you are in a hurry.  But that did allow me to see how they work, and let me tell you, they work swiftly here.  Orders continually roll in and they do not miss a beat.  I cannot say that they have a set station that each of them man because they are all over the place and work so well together.\n\nI came in and looked at the menu, deciding fairly quickly and placed my order.  I then sat back and watched the show unfold in front of me.  Order in, orders on the grill/in the fryer, going on break/coming back, answering the phone, bagging up the orders and doing it all over again.  It was exhausting to watch, but enjoyable.\n\nI went with the two beef dog combo deal.  You can have them topped however you please with a ton of combinations.  This comes with fries and for a little extra you can get them topped with cheese.  For the beef dogs they slice them down the middle and grill them face down.  Great technique as they get this bit of charred taste to them and give it a bit of a crunch.  They are then placed in fresh steamed buns and topped to your liking.  Also comes with a drink and does not break the bank at all.  An aside, cash only.  Make sure to have cash on you or stop before getting here.\n\nThe dogs tasted amazing and fresh.

Red Dragon also uses real plates, silver-wear, and glasses; which again not all Chinese places in the area do.

Yelp's Content Guidelines have a general guideline that says not to review your own business, and doing so is a conflict of interest.

We politely asked for a full refund of the food we didn't eat,and were told that we had not ordered from them at all. We had to repeat ourselves several times to establish the fact that yes, we did order this food, we had the order in front of us.  He then said that the containers don't melt. Well, this picture of the container I have says otherwise.  He continously interrupted us over the phone, berated us for yelling at him (which we didn't do, we simply asked for a refund and stated why), and when he was fed up told us that it was grubhub's problem instead and refused to accept any responsibility. Honestly, if he would have just been polite and directed us to grub hub in the first place,  this wouldn't be an issue,  but because of his behavior,  we will no longer be ordering from this establishment again.

We had a party of 8, in which I didn't think it should have been as difficult as she made it.  The restaurant was not busy at all, and there were so many empty seats all around us.\n\nWhen we were seated, our drink orders were taken and we decided to put in a few appetizers.

We just chalked it up and kept waiting.  So here we are, 1 hour 15 min later and finally the appetizers come out (only 3 lasagna frittas).  They were disappointing because they were not hot and the sauce started to settle and harden, which tells me they were done for a while sitting under a lamp, and then she finally decided to bring them to us.\n\nSo here we are 1 hour 40 minutes later and the entrees come out.  The mashed potatoes were cold, but the chicken was hot.  She brought another pitcher of pink lemonade, hence no drink refill order taken.

It is classy and old-fashioned like many a neighborhood restaurant, which puts it in the same realm as nearby Del's. Traditional, modest, and eternal are words that come to mind regarding Lombardozzi. A jolly family banquet was afoot in the room next to us, and we didn't mind in the least as we caught up with one another, carrying on with our lively conversation as the clan behind us did. Thus, we found that the atmosphere was highly welcoming. \n\nOverall, Lombardozzi swayed wildly between a 3 and a 4 and stopped somewhere in between for me. \n\nFor starters, service was somewhat spotty. We had 3 different servers ask us for our orders. Even the third and final server admitted that he was mildly annoyed with the lack of communication. \n\nWhy I ordered Crabmeat Imperial, I can't tell you. I really didn't know what else I wanted and figured its high price ($25!) would lead me towards seafood euphoria, and it mostly did. Crabmeat and stuffing filled a trio of oyster shells with thick, sweet, meaty succulence, but damn it if the portion was stingy! It was so miserly, I was jealous of what my dining companions ordered for their entrees were not only cheaper, their rations were far more generous!\n\nThe opening salad suffered from being overdressed with a vinaigrette that I would have liked had my greens not been swimming in it. \n\nMy last course, on the other hand, was a winning chalice of Bananas Foster, which I only ordered since the restaurant was out of most of their other desserts for the evening. A rite of cinnamon, caramel, vanilla ice cream, whipped topping, and of course, bananas, I was reminded of why BF is the most ornate of all sundaes. Warmth dandled with cold. Salt and spice embraced sugar and cream. Chunks of hot, pappy starch mingled with everything. Elegance, simple, elegance. \n\nDid I merely order poorly? You tell me.

I often drove past the store but up until two years ago I never stopped.  I mean how good could a pizza shop in the middle of Morningside be?  The answer is darn good.  I gave Eddie's a try on the recommendation of a friend.  My first order was for a pepperoni pizza.  It was at least as good as any pizza that I'd gotten from one of those places in Squirrel Hill.  The pie was cooked to perfection with a crispy outside crust. The red sauce has a kick to it and is not too spicy or sweet.  There was a generous portion of pepperoni and enough cheese that you'd never never have to order it as an extra.  From that day on Eddie's became my go-to pizza shop.  Their subs are reported to be even better than their pizza but I really can't speak to that.  I'm a pizza girl all the way.  I don't mean to give the impression that Eddie's doesn't have s few hiccups.  It's a family business and they shut their doors promptly at 10pm, and they're closed on Sunday.  At times the quality can be inconsistent.  Not the food itself, but occasionally there will be too much or too little sauce on the pie or the crust is less than crispy.  A lot depends on which member of the staff makes your pizza.  I always try to order between 4:00 and 9:00.  Eddie is almost always there at that time.  Eddie oversees all of the food preparation and nothing inferior leaves the shop when he's around.  Another minus is their delivery charge.

We found this restaurant on Yelp because we were looking for a new place to try. \n\nWhen we pulled in, there were only 2 cars in the lot and it made me think they weren't open. I asked my fianc\u00e9 if maybe that was a bad sign, and then we decided that we wanted to have the experience no matter what. We are so glad we went in!\n\nWe were one of two couples in the place, so we were seated immediately. The hostess was our server because they didn't have a server that night. We ordered drinks which came out timely, and then we put in an order for a Caesar salad to share and our dinner orders of chicken Romano and the veal medallions. The Caesar salad was a little over priced for what you get, so I wouldn't recommend tacking on $10 to your tab for a salad. Save it for your entree and dessert. The Caesar dressing was authentic though, so if you're in the mood to splurge, then splurge away! We also had bread with butter and pesto oil that was very good!\n\nOur dinners came out around an hour after we were seated, so considering everything is made in house and to order, an hour was the perfect wait. We had plenty of time to have a wonderful conversation and let our salad digest. My veal medallions was delicious, although for $26, I thought the pieces of veal would have been more substantial. Overall it was a very good meal. My fianc\u00e9 has the chicken Romano. He raved about it! I took a bite, and it was delicious! \n\nWe decided to make a whole night of it and ordered the chocolate explosion with berries. It was worth the 15 minute wait for it to be warmed up. \n\nThe decor was lovely, and I really loved the look of the bar area. We are excited to go back to try more things from the menu. We spent more than we had planned, but I think one of the best parts of this restaurant is that it can fit a less expensive budget if you don't add on the salad, drinks and dessert. Even without all of those extras, our dinner would have been excellent.

I can't believe this place only has 3 1/2 stars! If you love authentic Italian food like I do, this is the closest to Italy that you'll get in Pittsburgh! \n\nI had dinner reservations on a Saturday night for my boyfriend, my parents, and I.  When we arrived, we sat at the bar for a drink before we sat at our table. We ended up making great conversation with the owners, a fabulous couple who are both so sweet! They even brought us out a plate of his homemade Soppressata. My father has had a lot of soppressata in his life (including his own family's homemade in Italy) and he said this was the best he's ever had! The rest of us agreed with him as well. They also had homemade bread with an amazing olive oil dipping sauce. They kept bringing it out, and we continued to eat it! \n\nFor dinner, it was a beautiful June night, so we decided to eat outside. All of the other customers were also eating outside ( I don't think anyone was inside eating). Their patio is so cute, covered with trees and umbrellas! We continued to have amazing service during our meal by both the owners and our waitress. For my dinner, I ordered chicken piccata and shared a side of the gnocchi with Chris. Both were amazing! Everyone else said how amazing their meals were too- eggplant parm, veal parm, and Chris tried rabbit (which was actually great!) \n\nSince we were there to celebrate, we also decided to get dessert! Even though we were all full, we saw the table next to us order dessert and we were basically drooling looking at it. The 4 of us shared the lemon tart & the raspberry chocolate chip gelato. I am not much of dessert person but these were both amazing & the perfect ending to a great meal! Even if you don't live close to Nancettas (like us) it was worth the drive!

Beautiful decor, flawed concept. \n\nThe good: the restaurant is absolutely beautifully decorated inside. The waitress knew the menu very well, was polite, made good suggestions, and never let our water glasses get even half empty. The veal Romano and seafood pasta dishes were tasty. \n\nThe bad: I wanted to take my mom out somewhere nice for an early mother's day dinner. She had been wanting to try this place out for a long time. The restaurant is very small and it was hard to make a reservation. When we got there, it was practically empty of people but full of tables. The two of us were seated at a table for 6. Why...I don't know. Because there were too many tables, we were practically sitting with the two women next to us. \n\nIt took over 10 minutes for the manager to tell us the specials. Another few minutes the one and only waitress came and took our drink order. Once our drinks are delivered, we ordered an appetizer (risotto balls), the veal and leek soup, and the best salad. The risotto balls came....45 minutes later. They were OK (nothing to write home about). Another 30 minutes later my soup arrives but my mom's salad wasn't ready. At 8:30 (90 minutes into dinner), my mom's salad finally arrived. Again, the food was OK. At this point we're beginning to get upset at how long we've waited to have our appetizer, soup, and salad served. There were only 8 people in the dining room and everyone has been waiting far too long and starts asking the waitress where the food was. We can all tell she's getting upset that a nearly empty dining room is full of hungry customers. \n\nThe ugly: At this point, it's almost 9 pm and everyone has been there since between 7 and 7:30. The waitress starts apologizing to everyone about the delay. She says this is typical and whenever she puts pressure on the kitchen, she states the chef just yells at her. Several couples just ask for their food to go. At 9:00, the food starts coming out. Everyone has been served except us. We hear our waitress tell the chef she still needs a veal Romano. Does that mean they didn't ever start cooking our food? Our food arrives at 9:15...2 hours and 5 minutes after we were seated. We ate some of our meals but we were just too tired to eat any more. We get the rest of our meals wrapped up to go. \n\nNancettas prides itself on its meals being \"scratch made in house.\" They state that their meals take a little longer than most restaurants. Making your customers wait 2 hours is bad for business. \n\nHow can a restaurant be successful if it alienates its customers by making them wait an ungodly amount of time before serving them? How can a restaurant be profitable if it can only turn a table once in a dinner session? The issue here is management turning a blind eye to a major issue and a failed concept. We will not be back and we certainly will not be recommending this place to anyone.\n"}, {"author": "Thomas A.", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2019-02-09", "description": "We waited an hour for our apps.

We had reservations for 5pm on a Saturday evening which is a must if you want prime time on a weekend.We called a week ahead of time and they only had two time slots remaining, 5pm and 8pm. The restaurant was very small inside, about 10 tables, all that could be pushed together if there was a larger crowd. We were seated right away and the waitress had water waiting for us on the table. She gave us a run down of the menu and the specials for the evening and gave us time to decide.\n \nThe menu offered a few starter options that were more unique than your average Italian restaurant. We ordered the White Bean Dip served with bread made by Mediterra and our friends tried the Burrata, warmed tomatoes and peppers in oil with fresh basil and mozzarella. I thought both appetizers were pretty good! The dip had a nice garlic kick and the Burrata was basil forward which was to my liking. We were also served bread with dipping oil to begin our dining experience. \n\nThe menu offered a variety of salads to choose from. My friend ordered the special - an apple and kale salad. It had nice flavor but had a little too much dressing for my liking. The entree section (or Pasta section) of the menu was not very big. Most items contained some form of pork ingredient, whether it was hot sausage, meatball, or pancetta. I debated between Linguini Carbonara and Spaghetti and Meatballs and finally settled on good ole' Spaghetti. It came with one giant meatball that was fairly tender with a decent amount of flavor. The pasta itself, while I could tell it was homemade, was a bit tough for my liking. The sauce was slightly watery but there was enough to cover the pasta and meatball entirely when mixed together. Overall, I thought the dish was good but next time I would try the Carbonara. \n\nThree additional sections of the menu include sandwiches (if you aren't feeling pasta), others and extras such as greens and beans, house meatball, chicken parm, and desserts. Despite each section being on the smaller side, this restaurant does offer a variety of options that are made with fresh ingredients in a \"scratch\" kitchen style.\n\nDespite a few minor hiccups with my dish, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here.

The gnocci was soft, light, and best I've ever tasted.\n\nOverall, I would revisit and try something else because they are providing great food. Price is pretty fair, you don't get a large portion, but it is filling for the amount they give, which is what i like at a restaurant. \n\nThese are reason why i would pay more to eat local rather than going to a chain like olive garden!\n\nI would recommend calling for reservation and giving your full name. I sat by the entry and overheard a customer only leaving a first name and she was not found on the list. She was still seated but i would hate to be there and not have a table! It's a small, quaint place, that just makes you feel hip, comfy, and satisfied.\n"}, {"author": "Lindsey H.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-07-12", "description": "Loved everything about this place and can't wait to go back!

Takeout is available and I noticed upon entry a reservation book thus concluding they take reservations as well. The theme is Italian/French. The business was opened by chef Greg Alauzen formerly known in some of Pittsburgh's better restaurants.\n\nThe place is very clean and the staff warm and friendly. The restaurant is average size and sits about a mile west from the center of Carnegie business district. I decided to order for lunch the veggie sandwich that consisted of roasted portabella mushrooms, peppers, white bean spread, and frisee. They use bread from Mediterra bakery located in Robinson.  All sandwiches come with a side of pickled vegetables. This is probably one of the few vegetarian choices on the menu. There are none for vegans.\n\nI noticed that portion sizes are fairly huge so come hungry. I got my food fairly quickly since the place wasn't overcrowded. My mushrooms were huge in my sandwich. Although I loved the sandwich I had some trouble biting the bread. I later learned after I completed my sandwich that they had given me \"end\" pieces of the loaf and I could have had a choice of a different softer bread. The menu does not list the bread choices so I would have not known this option existed.\n\nWhen I ordered my ice tea I learned they only serve it sweetened. Unsweetened ice tea is not available so do not be mislead by the menu. My tea was filled completely with an orange wedge attached. I asked for a straw and was told they had none. Later on I learned that they were ordering straws and would have them next time I visit. Right now the place is BYOB, however, they have applied for a liquor license so this will change in the near future.\n\nMy waitress asked me if I wanted dessert. I skipped over that in favor of one of those delicious meatballs. They sell for $3.00 but judging by the size one is good enough for me. My waitress brought me a few \"center\" cuts of the same bread I had with my sandwich and it was a lot easier for me to chew. I must say the meatball was worth every penny and I enjoyed that over my sandwich.  The meatball is also available as a combo with pork and house sausage. Prices are reasonable.\n\nI feel this place is a work in progress seeing that it has just opened and still has to get what I call some of the \" bugs\" worked out of it. Menu corrections should be made so that the consumer would know about the two types of bread they serve as well as correction for the ice tea (should be labeled \"sweet tea\"). Also since I didn't order a dessert I have no idea of pricing since desserts are not on their online menu. Still it makes a welcome addition to an up and coming community in Carnegie. There is metered parking along W. Main St but you can obtain free parking if you park along one of the side streets. It sits about a block down from Applelicious where you can also get a sweet treat.\n"}, {"author": "Kara B.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2018-10-08", "description": "Leogreta gets a solid 5 stars for sure! \n\nI called on a Saturday for a 5:30 reservation before a Pens game.

It was even busy at 5:30. \nMy husband ordered the spaghetti and meatball. He basically licked the plate clean and could not stop raving about it! The meatball was huge and tasty, and the sauce was plentiful and on the sweeter side (which we love). \nI ordered the cavatelli with sausage because judging from yelp, it looked like a fan favorite. It was incredible! The homemade cavatelli was delicious and so was the sauce it was served in. The sausage is also made in house. Actually, I think everything is. The desserts are served with Millie's ice cream which is always a plus!!\nThe service also gets a solid 5 stars. Even though every table was full, our water glasses were never empty and we were checked on multiple times by multiple staff members! \nOne small complaint, but I'm not going to hold this against them.... the $20 corking fee!

The restaurant is very small (maybe 10 or so tables) so I recommend making a reservation. Our server, Roberta, was absolutely amazing!! She was warm and welcoming, quick to make a suggestion and very attentive. The first thing I noticed was after ordering my drink, it was brought to the table with a straw. Typically I try to not use straws but I had left mine at home and to my extreme surprise and delight it was a paper straw! \n\nWe started with the buratta which did not dissapoint! It was warm with the right amount of salt and paired perfectly with included bread. I started my meal with a Caesar salad and it was very good, the croutons were exceptional. For dinner I had the Carbonara which was made in the correct Italian fashion of adding raw eggs to the dish as opposed to cream. You can certainly tell the difference and this was very good. One of my friends got the cavatelli and sausage and it was to die for. There is no red sauce as you may expect, instead it is coated in the oils from the sausage with some added spice. Lastly my other friend got the gnocchi, it is clearly home made and melts in your mouth. The consistency of it was better than any other gnocchi I have had at a restaurant. We also ordered a side of hot sausage and a meatball. The hot sausage has an absolutely amazing flavor! The meatball was good but it tasted as if it was only made with beef and was a little dense for my liking. \n\nTo end our meal, my friend ordered the Panna Cotta, her favorite dessert. It came in the most adorable pot with a lid. The Panna Cotta was slightly more dense than others she has had but the pure raw honey, from the chefs personal farm, added a wonderful sweetness that really took the dish up a notch. \n\nAll in all we will be back again to sample other dishes and possibly have a few of the ones we tried this time.

And not huge - you can definitely eat the whole thing alone.  The gnocchi were some of the best I have had in a long while.  The meatball was middling for me, but I'm not a huge meatball person.  In the end, the burratta and the gnocchi were enough and I really didn't need it.   I also sampled a white bean dip and the carrot cake - both were really good.   \n\nThe only two complaints I had...   One, the corkage fee is just ridiculous at $5 per glass delivered to the table.  I am not a huge fan of corkage fees in general, but can agree that wine glasses and corkscrews aren't free.  $5 total for the table is really about all I'm willing to suck up though - the per bottle and/or per glass nonsense is really for the birds.  As a result of this fee, none of us bothered to bring wine - which is really the opposite of what you are going for in having a corkage fee.  Second, the place is excessively loud.

I don't have great hearing in my right ear, so why would I want to spend a full meal struggling to hear?  This instantly takes away from any experience for me.  \n\nOur server was very nice, and came over to me immediately to get my drink order while I waited on my friend.

After I got past the initial shock of it, I got used to the tartness and it was alright.  The meatball was meh.  It was large, and clearly had been over-handled during prep.  It was tough, and the flavor was just ok.  The pasta itself was good.  I want to say it was homemade, but don't hold me to that.  It was very delicate and nicely al dente.  \n\nI'm sorry, LeoGreta!  I really wanted it to work out differently for us.  I'm just spoiled by my own mother's sauce and meatballs.  I grew up being fed a sauce that rivals ambrosia, and meatballs that just melt in your mouth releasing this flavor unmatched by any other.  It's a super tough act to follow, and so far, only one restaurant has satisfied my long distance cravings.  \n\nI plan on returning and giving it another shot.

Parking was easy enough (we parked on Hazelwood between Greenfield Ave and Murray), plus there are always street spots by the Giant Eagle. They have a counter that you order at and it is a casual restaurant so you don't feel like you are intruding on anyone's dining experience by picking up food. A really nice teenage girl took our order and prepared it. \n\nI believe the food is Iranian. They have things like shawarma, falafel, tabbouleh, bread pockets with fillings, etc. Prices are very inexpensive, probably a few dollars less than what Aladdin's charges. My favorite was the beef shawarma which had tender beer slices (instead of the tougher chunks that I've gotten at other places).  The falafel was so-so and could of used some better toppings (pickle was odd)  but the yogurt sauce that came with one of the sandwiches was excellent and they gave you a big cup of it.  \n\nTheir bread was perfect, with middle eastern food the bread needs to be on point or the whole meal just ends up being mediocre.  Their bread is delicious, soft and pillowy but still toothy enough to be used in a sandwich without it falling apart. \n\nEach of the sandwiches came with some average fries. We also liked the pockets (I can't remember the menu name)...the tabbouleh was incredibly fresh but I felt it needed a bit more of a zip...more citrus or something. \n\nOverall I the price/quality ratio of the food is excellent and I will definitely be back.

Staying in a charming little AirBnb across the street from The Huddle, and decided to try it on our second night. We liked it so much, we ordered take out for a late lunch today (the kitchen doesn't open until 4).  It is going to be really hard to not eat here everyday. It was game night so it was packed to the brim, always a good sign. I could imagine coming here with friends for a few beers and a bite. Dark, very Pittsburgh vibe going on. I loved it. Those that said their service was horrible are too critical. You can tell the servers have probably worked there for YEARS and give two shits what you think about them. Our server warmed up to us a lot more at the end. It didn't bother us, they were busy as hell. The drunk woman next to us started up a conversation immediately with us. We felt like family! \n\nStarted with loaded fries which were what you would expect from east coast cheese fries. Covered in gooey, sticky cheese sauce and bacon. Husband had pork chops, which he loved. I had the 10 ounce new york cooked medium. It was cooked perfectly, and not overly seasoned. As one of my sides I ordered the pasta for baby O, who is a spaghetti connoisseur (kidding mostly). Of course I had to take a bite of the carbey goodness, and holy smokes- that was some of the best red sauce I have ever had. Who knows, maybe I am crazy and it is some kind of Pennsylvania jarred sauce; either way it was freakin delicious. R's meatball sandwich made me super jelly I didn't order it myself. The meatballs were super tender, and there was that sauce again.\n\nOnto today's lunch. Last night we forgot to order the ever so famous wings so of course that was first choice. Also, I NEEDED some of that spaghetti;  yes, needed. In addition I have been craving a Ruban. I don't know much about Ruban's, but this one was more then excellent. It had the perfect amount of cheese, dressing, crout, meat, and the bread was toasted to perfection. The wings were everything everyone raves about. We did them tanned as suggested.

Definitely like how close The Huddle is but after many meals here I won't return. Being so close is why we've continued to revisit and the quality was fair enough and sometimes mostly good. The fried fish used to be good but now appears to be frozen freezer bag fare along with their appetizer platter. And the rest of the sandwiches are fair at best. What is most concerning is one occasion when we ordered rare steak instead of medium...they took steak back to the kitchen and put it back on grill. Another meal they took the undercooked salmon back to the kitchen grill and our latest meal undercooked scrod taken back to kitchen as well. Health safety standards...once food makes it to the table it can't be taken back to kitchen and placed back on the grill or honestly even reenter the kitchen. I'm ok enough with that if there was an improvement when you receive the food again. The latest meal no improvement in the undercooked scrod...the fish was not flaky and still had opaque undercooked color. When I told the server she told me...well he cooked it for 7 more minutes. The fish wasn't hot but she was saying it was fine.  No apology no offer for something different. I just said ok...we weren't rude and I didn't want to ask for manager and have more drama...the server would just label us as complainers.  In addition the baked potato was lukewarm at best and my dining companion ordered the eggplant parmigiana which comes with Portobello mushrooms...she let her know the mushrooms had a strong vinegar taste. The server told us those weren't Portobello mushrooms that it was eggplant...hmm ok. Regardless the point was too much vinegar/bad taste no matter what she thinks it is called.  As an aside the menus says there are mushrooms on the dish too. Clearly the server didn't want to hear it or fix it and we just said ok. Aside from this dining experience we've had consistently old lettuce in salads...fried mushrooms still frozen in middle. They took my order of mushrooms back to kitchen and refried them after I had been eating from them. So that's another example of a food safety issue. After many meals and many tries and eating there two to three times a month for a couple years we're done.

It's really easy to brush it off if you're walking by; from the outside it looks like a pretty standard bar. And when you walk in, it smells like a pretty typical bar - meaning that if this place ever closed, the next owner would have to rebuild the entire place to get the cigarette stench out. So yeah, I admit that my first impression was not a good one, and I actually thought to myself that if any more people showed up and started smoking I'd have to ask my friend to pick somewhere else for us to eat and talk.\n\nFortunately, between it being a Thursday, the snow and the bitter cold temperatures, very few people showed up and the majority of the smokers stuck to the main bar area. So I picked a booth in the far corner of the seating room and met up with my friend; while I waited for them I took a peak at the menu - nothing super spectacular, but the prices were pretty cheap overall. So hey, at we know this bar has cheap sandwiches and cheap burgers.\n\nOnce my friend arrived we both ordered some drinks, because of course you drink when you're in a place like Nico's. The beer and cider we ordered came in a glass and the original bottle respectively, and our water came out in plastic cups (something I'm admittedly not a big fan of - it's such a wasteful practice). We then split the fried zucchini and the recovery room pizza. The fried zucchini basket had four or five enormous stripes of zucchini and came with marinara sauce - it was quite tasty, although the sauce was pretty cold. Maybe it's just me, but I'd rather have warm marinara sauce than cold. The pizza, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious. The recovery room special is a specialty; it has gyro meat, feta cheese on top on regular cheese, mushrooms and green peppers. This was VERY good, and I'm sure the fact that they make the pizzas to-order was part of why I found it to be so yummy. And by the way, my friend and I both took some pizza home with us - it was an enormous meal and more than either of us needed. So don't let the prices on the pizza frighten you, they're worth it.\n\nThe good news is that overall my experience definitely got better as the night went on. The bad news is that I honestly don't think I'll go back to Nico's, at least not for quite a while. As delicious as the pizza was, nothing can make up for the fact that this place is a smoker's haven. With lungs as sensitive as mine, this is a dealbreaker, and I'm pretty sure it was only by pure chance that I came in on a night where no one was smoking near me; if the place had been any busier I'd've had to leave just so I could breathe normally, I'm sure. I'll still give the place an \"a-ok\" rating since the food was delicious, the prices were good, and our waiter (who I think was bar-tending as well) was very nice and very attentive overall. But with such a strong smoke smell an \"a-ok\" is all I can honestly give.\n"}, {"author": "Shana M.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2016-06-22", "description": "This was my favorite spot to grab wings.

She said she would check with the kitchen and offered me new vegetables. I declined. When she returned, the server relayed that the kitchen said they washed the broccoli and I must be mistaking the texture of the quinoa for grit. Huh? I've been cooking for 40 years and eating longer.

When I walked in the door, I was immediately greeted by the guy behind the counter and a guy who I assume was the owner.  I asked him if they served pizza by the slice, and he said that indeed, they did, though they'd have to make a fresh pie.  I said, \"But I can still buy just a couple slices, right?\", and he assured me that this was the case.  I told him that in that case, I'd have two slices of plain.  He told me it would take about ten minutes, so I went for a walk around the block.\n\nWhen I returned about ten min. later, the owner told me it'd be one more minute and I said that was fine, and that I'd wait.  At this point, another guy who I hadn't talked to before saw my CMU t-shirt and asked me if that was where I went to school.  I told him that I'm finished with school, and that I work as a researcher now.  He asked me what I research, and I told him, and he told me he thought my topic of research was really interesting, and proceeded to show me that he even knew a bit about it.  I was impressed, since most people walking around don't know much of anything about my topic of research (though many people find it interesting, nevertheless!).\n\nAnywho, I took my box of slices back to my apt., where I opened it.  The slices smelled and looked good, but they seemed a bit greasy, and the crust seemed a bit soft.  After dabbing off a bit of the grease and sprinkling on a bit of Italian seasoning, I proceeded to eat them.  As I predicted, the flavor was good--the sauce was a bit on the sweeter side, and the cheese was classic mozzarella--but the crust wasn't crispy.  So, while they were good, they don't beat out the crispy-crusted slices of Pizza Prima, my Craig St. pizza standby.  On the other hand, they're definitely better than chain pizza slices (Papa John's, Domino's, etc.).

I came into the restaurant on a Friday afternoon and was greeted by the owner. I asked him the dimensions of the Large Pizza, and he couldn't even give me a definitive answer. He just said 12 slices, which gives me absolutely no information about how big it is. I ended up ordering a medium Nipper's Specialty (combination pizza).\n\nWhen I got back home, I was astonished that anyone could actually ruin pizza. The green bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions weren't cut thinly, and as a result, soaked the pizza. The pizza had no flavor because the water diluted all of the salt in the cured meats (pepperoni and bacon). Furthermore, the dough was chewy because they didn't bake it long enough to evaporate the water. Simply put, it was a bad experience.\n\nI will never come here again. $15 for a medium mediocre specialty pizza is a joke. I would much rather go to Pizza Prima, which is only half a block away.\n"}, {"author": "Mario S.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2014-05-31", "description": "I give this 4 star review though I have only eaten two things there the pizza and the bread sticks,( great deal for large cheese with breadsticks...

An Iceberg Wedge Salad complete with bleu cheese dressing (not my favorite, but it was the only choice I was given) and bacon bits. For burps and chuckles I ordered it an was surprised at how much enjoyment I gained from breaking it down, making sure each forkful of fresh lettuce arrived in my mouth coated in the biting, milky dressing and fatty, crunchy, briny bacon, the tragically unheralded and sometimes derided salad succeeding through simplicity and tradition. \n\nDessert was a pecan ball slathered in whipped topping from a plastic tub and hot fudge that was irradiated in a glass jar (Smuckers be thy name?).

My Basil Chicken used such fresh ingredients and was cooked perfectly. The flavors could all be tasted and were perfectly combined; the lunch portion size was decent too. My wife's Pad Thai was cooked perfectly as well. The noodles weren't too greasy and the flavors were great.

Broken wine glasses. Ranch all over my phone. Missing entrees.\n\nI made a reservation at Calabria's a few weeks before traveling into town for my aunt's memorial dinner. During that call, I gave directions about what we wanted for the meal, including a specific menu and a memorial area. That's why when we arrived and were asked all the same questions again, I was a little bit confused. Our table of 13 shouldn't have been extremely taxing for the waiters, yes I said waiters plural, but what we didn't know is that we should've buckled up for the next 2 hours.\n\nEvery time our main waiter came from the kitchen, he would announce how the next step of dinner worked. \"I'm going to put your order in and then you'll get your salads.\" How else does this work? Every interruption like this left our whole table speechless.\n\nWe ordered a few bottles of wine, specifically a Cabernet Sauvignon and a Riesling. We received a Merlot and were asked about what we wanted besides a Riesling, since they were out. We were told we wouldn't want the Chardonnay....except that's what we ended up picking. That's way closer than a Ros\u00e9 or another red. \"We'll pour it,\" we said. We didn't want to take the chance of having wine all over us. When the wine glasses were on their way out, they all of a sudden tumbled onto the floor. \"Don't worry, only 1 broke\" said our waiter. We turned around and there's 5 on the floor.\n\nWhen our orders were taken, half of the table was forgotten about. I actually had to leave the table and grab a waitress to finish taking our order. I'm not sure how you miss 4 people at the table, but it happened. When our appetizers arrived (soups and salads) the waiter didn't know what salad dressing was which. \"Is that ranch?\" It's definitely Italian.\" It was definitely not Italian. When my salad was reached over my shoulder, the ranch spilled all over my phone which was sitting on the table. Who know ranch coating could make a phone look so good? \n\nWhen the food arrived, it was left on trays staring at us, waiting to be handed out for what felt like 5 minutes, getting cold, before the food reached the actual table. Waiting on the last meal, the waiter was more concerned about sides than making sure the last meal made it to the table.\n\nOur meal ended with our waiter asking if we brought a cake. Um, no. And upon handing my credit card back left us with his parting comment, \"I hope things go good for you guys.\" Did the memorial table we created not hint to that fact that this was a memorial? Awkward.\n\nThe best part...that our family was together. Definitely not anything about this place!\n\nThe worst part...wishing I had made a reservation somewhere else.\n\nEver since I was a kid, I heard people rave about Calabria's. What are any of those people thinking? I honestly don't understand why this place is so packed. It is beyond me how anyone enjoys this food. For a family restaurant I expected so much more!

Generally when we order Chinese we drive all the way down town to our favorite place but I just didn't feel like driving that far, or paying that price (I have a big family).  As a result I did what any intelligent person should do and I hit up Yelp for recommendations!\n\nI scoured the local area for non-chain take-out joints and was suddenly reminded of my youth when I saw Chan An pop up with 4 stars!  Years ago, when I lived in the neighborhood, I frequented Chan An and it was always pretty good.  In fact, I remembered the food being good and fairly inexpensive!  I decided that it was time to return to yesteryear and did some searching on-line for a menu. I don't think that the menu has changed much in 15 years. Trust me, there are a TON of options here.  In spite of a million options we ordered the usual for our family which is: a couple orders of sweet and sour chicken, General Tso's Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice, and some egg rolls.  Like I said, i'm feeding a small army.  I was pleasantly reminded of how quickly they prepare food when I was told the order would be ready in 10 Minutes!\n\nI immediately hopped in the car and ran over to pick the order up.  I live just over 10 minutes away and, believe it or not, everything was prepared and neatly packed right as I arrived.  Perhaps the best part, which almost made this 4 stars for me, was the PRICE!  When I go down town for Chinese we are easily close to $70.  I expected Chan An to be around $50 considering all that we ordered but I was completely wrong.  Our entire order was $35!!!  I was thrilled, and horrified because sometimes you get what you pay for.  However, it cost me $35 to feed my family at McDonald's!  With the 4 star yelp rating in mind, I focused on being thrilled!  \n\nIn the end, all of the food was great.  My wife even said that she though the chicken in the Sweet and Sour chicken was slightly better than \"Dahn Tahn\".  I disagree, the food is hands-down better at the other place but Chan An was a win with everyone.  The food was all hot and prepared properly.  The meat was tender, the sauces were tasty, and the rice was steamed properly.  What more could you ask for?  In the end, I'd expect to pay close to $50 for this meal.  At $35 it is a steal and we will be back.  I didn't go with a 4 star rating because price is just not enough for me to rate a place with 4 stars.  The food was good, but it just wasn't 4 star good.  I'd go 3.5 stars if I could... but I can't.... so 3 stars it is.  Don't be afraid of 3 stars...

Glad I did, because I'm now a fan.\n\nIt's definitely better than Phong May House (see my review if you want to compare). I think my initial reservations about going here revolved around what it looked like from the outside, and to some degree what it looks like on the inside as well. It's in the Crafton Ingram Shopping Center and it looks like a dive. But it's a great dive. There are tables for dine-in eating, but I'd say more than 90% of Chan An's business is take out. They don't do delivery.\n\nBut that's no big deal, as the food is always ready in about ten minutes, unless they're really busy, in which case it'll be twenty. So what's good here?\n\nWell, for starters, I love the wonton soup. Chan An uses a dark broth that is actually packed with flavor, unlike all the other Chinese eateries in the area which stick to a chicken-based broth, which is always flavorless for the most part. I don't get how that happens. Someone please explain it to me. The lack of flavor, not the base, that is.\n\nI'm a fan of the sweet and sour pork here, as well as the cashew chicken. I've noticed Chan An likes to use lightly battered dark meat pieces of chicken with a darker sauce when it comes to some of their dishes such as the cashew chicken. It can sometimes be a little salty, but most days it's right on the money. Plus they also throw in water chestnuts, which I love and wish more Chinese restaurants would do.\n\nThe egg rolls are really good. Not greasy, not overdone, but just right. The fried wontons are good and the beef on the stick is amazing. It's not your usual beef on a stick. Well, it is, but then they wind up deep frying the beef before skewering it, and I've never had it like that, but it's really tasty. It bring out the sweetness of the beef really well.\n\nThe people who run the place are super friendly and they'll do their best to accommodate your tastes if you want something made a little differently. The prices are good and in line with other affordable Chinese restaurants. So don't let the look of the place fool you. Chan An does a lot of business and I'd say that's mostly down to the quality of their food. Convenience is nice, too, but that doesn't always make for tasty eats. So give these guys a try if you've been on the fence about 'em like I was. I dig their vittles. \n\nUPDATE: 12/22/2014\n\nI'm upping my review of Chan An's to five stars (from four). It's become my regular go-to stop for quick and tasty Chinese food. The whole place is like one big happy family between the employees and the clientele. Everyone who goes is pretty much a regular.\n\nA couple nights ago, I went and after I came in and placed my order, a small army arrived behind me. It got rather crowded quickly with everyone standing around waiting to get their takeout. At one point, the cashier was trying to tell one of the customers where the various sauce packets were and saw that there was one packet of soy sauce left in the bin. I offered to help him restock, and he directed me to where they kept all the packets. I was soon refilling the bins as fast as I could. It was amusing. It's that kind of place.\n\nI returned again last night and te same guy and I talked a bit while I was waiting for my order. He had gone to the Strip District earlier in the day and bought some cheese. So we started discussing our mutual love for cheese, and I directed him to Wheel and Wedge and their great cheeses. He sliced off a piece of his Strip District cheese and handed it to me to share. It was tasty. I know this has nothing to do with Chan An's food, but it's this sort of laidback and enjoyable experience that keeps me coming back as much as the vittles.\n"}, {"author": "Nichole B.", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2016-12-13", "description": "I'm giving it a solid two.

I arrived and without even asking if I was here for take out or dine in the only person I saw working l in the restaurant the entire hour I was there told me to sit down. She helped the couple before me with their take out which was fine with me. I would have preferred to be asked if I wanted a seat in the dining area prior however that I could overlook. I sat down after she led me to the table and I ordered my meal ( eventually ) she was the only employee outside the kitchen so she had to answer the phones and take orders and then when people came to collect their take out she had to go back and forth between the kitchen and the register to check people out. There should have been a person which would wait on customers and someone Else to run back and forth between the kitchen, the register and answering phone. When she finally got to me I told her when I placed the order I had a coupon. I then asked to have broccoli because I prefer broccoli vs baby corn.  She arrived with the food without the broccoli. I asked her to please bring out the broccoli separate. She brought the smallest amount of broccoli I've seen in my life. I've seen more broccoli in lean cuisine frozen dinners. Then she says it's extra $2 so okay I'm not happy but I'll survive. I figured I'm getting $2 off with my coupon so it's a wash.40 minutes later I ask for my check and mention again I have a coupon. I asked for a take home container. She brings the take home box and the check. I give her the phone with the coupon from the entertainment app and she makes a huge fuss I didn't tell her about the coupon first so she won't accept it. I flat out told her I advised you three times I had a coupon I was using. It is not my problem that you are so busy worrying about checking out others, running back and forth to the kitchen to get take out orders and answering calls that you didn't hear me.

It's a great price and the buffet is very good, wish there were more of a food section offered, but what is there is really good. There is never a crowd and for the most part your able to pick where you would like to sit. Hunan's Palace is located at the end of a strip mall in Forest Hills, with plenty of free parking. They offer take out and will deliver just to the surrounding area. They offer coupon discounts when your able to find them. The restaurant is reasonable priced for American Chinese food. It is convenient being only two Chinese restaurants in the area. We have been going for years now and it has kind of lost its charm for me. I do like the buffet when I am home during the week day and able to go. We do not order out as often as we used to. The owners have always been friendly, not as talkative as they used to be, but very polite. I see mostly the husband these days, the wife is mostly in the kitchen now if at all. If you can over look the outdated decor, it is not a bad place for dinner or lunch. I would recommend take out, it's quick and packaged very well.  The chicken dishes are well prepared, I like the freshness of the vegetables and the good hot sauces that they make. I also have been ordering from the healthier menu with the white sauce and more vegetables, and less of the meats or poultry. The fried rice's have all been consistently good.  I love the spring rolls, but I am not fond of the egg rolls. The Won Ton Soup is too salty for me and I like the pork shredded on top of the soup and not in the wrapper. \nAs for a comment made by someone about an extra gratuity added to the bill, I can't speck to that, I have never had that happen to me.

I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.  \n\nInside, it's bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word?  I just don't know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  \n\nOne random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.  \n\nNot only will I return, but I will also recommend Marge's Place to anyone in the area.  It was a surprisingly good find.  I like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong.\n"}], "OvDy9zJLGmfPgiKRUsIb4Q": [{"author": "Jayme B.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-05-11", "description": "My coworker brought me here for lunch this week. It's nestled right on Smithfield Street, but it wasn't super busy during the lunch hour. The menu is typically deli foods: sandwiches, salads, a little case of prepared salads (pasta, tuna, chicken salad, etc). But one really cool thing was that they have a salad bar, so you can make your own salad. In the prepared food section, they also have little containers of grilled chicken that you can purchase to top your salad with some protein. I decided on that option. My coworker went with a half sandwich and soup. All of the vegetables and chicken were very fresh. The service was really good too- they offered to heat up my chicken, which I appreciated. The prices are pretty on-par for downtown. I'm very surprised this place wasn't busier than it was, but I'm glad it wasn't.

Set right in the middle of a construction zone-yes those orange barrels are out again, you have just enough space to \"squeeze through\" two of those cone heads if you are heading away from St Clair hospital towards Scott Twp.\n\nSituated in the former \"Life is sweet\" bakery cafe, the parking hasn't changed so it is easy for people to \"double park\" behind one another as was my case.\n\nTake out is available and you can order ahead of time online if you prefer. Once inside the setup is similar to the \"Life is sweet\" cafe. There are tables in front and some in the back along with reading material. Free WiFi is available. Passcode given upon request. I thought I would take advantage of the lunch pizza special since you get two slices of cheese pizza for just under $5.00 which includes a canned beverage or water.\n\nI asked about toppings and learned that any topping from the board can be ordered for an additional $.50 each. I asked about the choice of crusts. I was told that with the special all I was entitled to was the traditional crust. If you want the whole wheat or multigrain then you would have to purchase a whole pie. The smallest size has 6 cuts which is way too much for me. So I thought I would try the special and go from there.\n\nYes, there are gluten free options available as well as vegetarian. No vegan here. I placed my order and got it fairly quickly even though the place was packed with kids and young adults.\n\nI ordered the two slices with mushrooms and green peppers. The portion sizes were very generous but I could tell by tasting it that it may have been microwaved. The pizza was okay but not anything special that I would go out of my way for. It just reminded me of those take out chains (which I had previously noted you can do here) and is probably good for just that.\n\nThe two slices were more than enough for me. Didn't need a salad nor did I want to try a hoagie. Staff was friendly and pleasant but I didn't see how to dispose of my leftovers so I took it back to the counter and the clerk took it off my hands.\n\nIt is convenient to St Clair Hospital but dealing with both construction and parking can be a nightmare.

It was my first time going and most definitely my last. I was with a group of 11 people - when we arrived there were only two other people in the restaurant, so they were clearly not busy.  The waiter - JEFF - seemed to have some extreme difficulty writing down our orders. He came back a couple times saying they were out of things and asking to clarify a couple of our orders. It took a very long time to get our drinks. After putting down a draught beer for one of my friends Jeff said \"that might taste weird, we get a lot of complaints that the taps are flat and warm. I meant to tell you when you ordered but didn't.\" Lo & behold, the beer definitely had a weird taste. So...thanks for that, Jeff. Drinks trickled in throughout our stay, but we often had to ask for things at least twice. Jeff came back at some point and said \"i wrote down that someone ordered chicken fries but we don't sell that\" so we had to go around AGAIN to give him our orders. OBVIOUSLY NO ONE ORDERED CHICKEN FRIES. It took over an hour for food to start trickling in. Two people in my party never even received their meals.  Others had sides missing. Whole thing was a mess. I should note that the entire night Jeff Kent's saying \"I'm doing my best.\" You clearly weren't, Jeff. We finally ask for our checks and a ridiculous amount of time passed before a couple people went in asking what's going on. A girl appeared to be handling the checks and said they'd be out in a couple of minutes. More & more time passes so I finally went in asking what was going on. This girl was also clearly having difficulty because it appears Jeff didn't write anything down properly. I said that we were all going to leave soon and Jeff said \"you are NOT leaving without paying, that is stealing!\" And I said \"you didn't even bring half our food out.\" Jeff literally went from 0 to 100 and pointed at me yelling \"You are a fucking piece of trash! You're the most disgusting person I've ever met! You are trash!\" Jeff, not sure if you could hear or see yourself, but I certainly wasn't the piece of trash in this scenario. The manager on duty (bartender) was called over. She said she told Jeff to leave for the night. I said that I would hope he'd be fired for talking to me like that but she said she doesn't have that power because she's not actually a manager. So that was helpful. No one offered to comp us for anything, the \"manager\"/bartender did not apologize. The girl helping with the checks wasn't even working apparently, she just happened to stop in. She did not offer to comp us so I told her I would not be paying for anything I got. I've never been treated like this anywhere ever. Based on most other reviews, this place is a disaster and shouldn't be in operation. At the very least I hope they fire Jeff and he considers another occupation because he clearly is not a waiter.

They feature more than 27 beers on tap which is nice and have a full bar area with high top tables and some games. \n\nTheir fish batter is a tad bland but the fish was white, fresh, and meaty so that sort of made up for the batter.

The Yelp reviews seemed favorable, so my SO and I ventured here on a weekend date night.  When we walked in to a completely empty restaurant at 7:00 PM on a Friday, neither of us had to really say anything to the other - our eyes locked with a puzzled \"should we stay or should we go?\"  \n\nBefore we could telepathically discuss things further, we were seated at a table and provided with menus.  My only gripe at this point would be that the tablecloths could've use a refresher between guests, ours had a few food stains/marks on it that looked to be from a prior meal - a bit unappetizing.  \n\nFinally verbalizing our thoughts, we agreed to try one or two rolls and see how they were before deciding if we would order more or mosey around Carnegie to find more to graze on.  We ordered the Chili Thai and Carnegie rolls - both were tasty, fresh, and rather different from any other roll I've tried in my sushi escapades.  The Chili Thai roll was definitely not shy on spice, but it was fresh and I was a fan of the red snapper on top.  The Carnegie roll didn't appear to have any rice inside, but the cuts of fish were generous and it was lightly fried.  This roll struggled to stay together when picked up, perhaps it wasn't rolled tightly or breaded enough, so a few pieces required a fork to pick up; however, the flavors were good and I liked how much fish was packed inside.\n\nOur total for the two rolls was about $27, which is on par with just about any other sushi place I've frequented.  We were still the only customers when we left, save for two or three people that came in to pick up takeout orders during our meal.  I'm not sure if it was just a quiet night in Carnegie or if we hit that sweet spot between the post-work and dinner crowds.  Though our initial reaction was wary due to it being so empty on a Friday, I was pleased with what we ordered and thought that it was fresh and the service was quick.

It's always disappointing to see a restaurant you've enjoyed trip up a bit with quality and service, but I think it's important to know as a paying customer.\n\nA few weeks ago, I called to order some sushi and was told the sushi chef was ill and was off work to recover, which of course is no big deal. Yesterday, my boyfriend and I left work early and I figured I'd order some sushi on my way home. When I first called to place my pickup order, the woman that answered seemed extremely frazzled. I ordered at 1:16PM after being on hold twice and was told it would be about 20 minutes, which is relatively standard for a takeout sushi order (usually anywhere from 10-20 minutes depending on business). We arrived right around 1:30 and my boyfriend went in to grab my sushi. I grew tired of waiting, and walked into the restaurant at about 1:45 to see what was going on. You'd think it was extremely busy if your takeout order is 10 minutes late and you're still waiting, but there were only a couple people in the restaurant including my boyfriend who was also patiently waiting for my sushi and sipping a glass of water.\n\nAs I waited at the bar trying to see what the issue was, the server appeared way more flustered than she should be with less than 5 customers including the two of us in the restaurant. My boyfriend told me that prior to me walking in, the woman was speaking audibly about the man at the bar (I guess he was friends with the owner) and how attractive she found him even though she had a boyfriend and that he made her very nervous. I stood at the bar area slightly confused and she had told me she was a few minutes late passing along my order to the sushi chef and also that he had cut himself and was working a bit more slowly. That's a hair unprofessional if you ask me. Even if the restaurant was packed to the max, the sushi chef is literally a few steps away in the kitchen and there is no excuse for as poor of service that she provided.\n\nI finally got my sushi and wasn't expecting compensation for the 45 minutes it took to get 3 rolls, but a sincere apology for the inconvenience would be nice. Other reviews mention a flustered, slow-servicing server and I'd be willing to bet it was the same woman that was there yesterday. Today's order included a Philly roll (always a Philly roll), a tuna roll, and a rock n' roll. I'm not so sure my order was right, but I ate it anyways. The tuna roll was drenched in 2 sauces and a mound of spicy tuna (good thing I'm ok with spicy foods), the Philly roll was ok, and I'm not 100% sure the third roll was a rock n' roll. It was fried as the menu described, but it was so loosely rolled and sloppy that only a few pieces stayed together as I was eating them. It also seemed like there was cream cheese inside, which the rock n' roll doesn't have. There were 2 sauces on this roll as well and they were heavy so it was a bit hard to tell what I was eating.\n\nTo put it kindly, I'm let down about what I've seen from Kasai in comparison to the good experiences I've had here before. There's no excuse for treating your customers like they aren't a priority and it has clearly been an issue other customers have experienced, too. Hopefully something changes, because I feel like this place has great potential if they get it together.\n"}, {"author": "Maria J.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2017-06-21", "description": "I was unfortunately disappointed with my recent lunch visit to Kasai.

Practically the whole front page of their menu is sushi but you are not limited to that. The left side shows the raw version and the right side shows the cooked version and will indicate whether or not it is spicy.\n\nOn the back of the menu are other offerings including entrees. I was delighted to find that I could have these same entrees for lunch. I opted for the vegetable hibatchi grill which includes fried rice, miso soup, and a side salad with ginger dressing. In addition I got a small plate of noodles with various dumplings on top among which were beef and shrimp.\n\nThe place is small and if you sit at the counter you can talk with the chef and see the various sushis in the counter. I sat at a table and was served the miso soup first. It was very good and then came the dumplings with noodles. These were especially good. The salad came next which is nothing out of the ordinary except it has a nice ginger dressing on top.\n\nWhen I got my main course I was pleased with the fact that they give you a good share of vegetables to equal the amount of rice. Most Asian places load you up on rice and don't give you enough of your entree. Not here. Portion size was just right and very good. Please note that this entree can be ordered with beef or chicken for a slight upcharge.\n\nNeedless to say it was a hearty and delicious lunch and was amazed that I got all that food for under $10.00. My waitress was very attentive to my needs and helped explained things to me. Next visit I will most definitely try the sushi. Kasai is located in the central business district of Carnegie and pay meter parking is available on the street or in a private central lot. It is best to come during the week if possible during the day since it was not too busy and easy to get seated.\n\nSo whether or not you order sushi I'm sure you will be pleased with Kasai. Take out is available and if you have the Eat 24 app you can use that to order out from this place.\n"}, {"author": "Diane B.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2018-06-05", "description": "I went for sushi.

Their Ruebens are   also killer (our waitress raved about them).  My wife and I both settled on fish sandwiches.  These are true Pittsburgh fish Sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy Mancini's Italian bread.  No adornments - just a boatload of hot crispy fish.  Emil's uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun.  Truly a great sandwich.  My daughter had the BLT - looked good and on good bread and they weren't skimpy with the bacon.\n\nThe service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks.

I will warn you that the cuban is made with bread & butter pickles, not dill- which knocked it down just a bit for me. \n\nMy daughter had a side of rice and beans and said it was the best she had ever had.

From my visit, I concluded that at this point, the food I got doesn't taste Dominican but more like a general Latin flavor. Anyways, this is what I think from all the food that I got: the rum cake was really moist and it tasted like rum, so bonus points. The empanadas were really good and I recommend them to anyone. They tasted homemade and freshly made. The chimi burger was great and I would recommend it to anyone. However, it would have been good if they ask me what temperature I would like my meat at because what I got was way too pink and burgers are not supposed to be eaten pink because of food born illness risks. The fried cheese was ok, but too spread out and consequently too greasy. I would recommend the chef/ owner to find a new cheese brand that fries better. The slaw was ok, but not anything I would call Dominican. The tostones were nothing to a toston. They were more like plantain chips, so that's a definitely no for me. Lastly, the sancocho is not Dominican by any far of the imagination. It was way not thick at all and it only had one meat. That sancocho was closer to a chicken soup  or Colombian sancocho than a Dominican sancocho. I didn't like it and would not get it again. Anyways, I'll be back there's more food to eat.

I was initially disappointed when the prior restaurant, Easy Street, left, but this place has definitely exceeded what I expected it to be.\n\nThe ordering concept is similar to a Sheetz or GetGo.  You go to any one of the computer screens and pick which of the different stations you want to order from.  After ordering you pick up your food at that station.  It can be intimidating on a busy day if it is your first time, but it is a very simple process.\nThe food can take a little time, so don't expect to be in and out in five minutes.  However, this is because they cook each individual meal to order.  Every pizza, sandwich, fry order, etc. is made fresh.  Nothing is ever sitting around.  \n\nI have now tried every station.  My favorite is Piccolo Italia.  The Bee Sting pizza is one of the best pizzas I have ever had.  It has spicy chili oil, fresh basil, and is drizzled with honey.  The flavors are incredible.  I have also had friends tell me the margarita pizza is good as well.  The pizza is cooked perfectly in their wood stone oven.  Always crispy.  They also have some other dishes like the chicken parm that I would like to try.  \n\nThe other stations which I also love are Flame, Pittsburgh Barbecue Company, and Spices.  Flame has a ton of different sandwich and side options.  I really enjoy the turkey burger and onion rings.  At the Pittsburgh Barbecue Company I had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese.  They loaded up the meat and the bbq sauce had a great flavor.  The Mac and cheese was also very good.  At Spices I have only had the tacos, but they are very good and have a lot of toppings to choose from.\n\nAnother great thing about here is you get free dressings and sauce sides.  Almost nowhere does this anymore, with some places charging 50 cents to a dollar for a side of ranch or bbq sauce.  It is definitely a nice touch.\n\nOn top of the great food, the workers here are very friendly and helpful.  Several times I have asked for an extra side or for something added and they always help me out even when they are super busy.  \n\nCould not be happier this place is in downtown!\n"}, {"author": "Karla D.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2019-03-06", "description": "My office is super close by and this is a place that my coworkers and I enjoy coming to on a regular basis.

Sure this is something that is seen at places like Getgo or Sheetz but those places aren't readily available to the downtown office worker during lunch M-F.\nI try to eat healthy (most of the time) and light during the day so it's usually salads for me.\nI absolutely love the pizza here though. So when I get that it's a real treat.\nWho remembers Easy Street? I sure do, it was here before the new dining conception we now have. Easy Street was fine but this is different and just better if you ask me.\n"}, {"author": "Arlene M.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2018-03-19", "description": "In the dust of the formerly located Easy Street rose this array of made to order and take out fast foods that can easily be overwhelming. Please note that this place opens at 11 for lunch on weekdays.\n\nSince there weren't a lot of people around when I arrived I walked though the market to get an idea of their different cuisines as well as grab and go items and snacks. As others have mentioned, there is an Italian station, a taco station, and a sandwich station called \"Flame\"(Just look at their buns with their name branded on them) which specializes in burgers, fish, and yes they serve a bean/quinoa style burger. The station I decided to try is actually a duel concept. One is Mediterranean called Zatar, and the other is Revolution where you can \"build\" your own noodle bowls. In the middle towards the back is the salad bar which I understood is pay what it weighs. I have yet to figure the cost. No one seemed to know who was sitting around me. Everything is customizable.\n\nI knew to purchase the beverages separately but as I made my way around I didn't see any prices to go with them. The same was true with the grab and go candy or grab and go refrigerated items (similar to what you would find at an airport.) I did purchase a bottle of water for $1.89.\n\nI asked for help and was told to order off one of the kiosks and if I wasn't pleased with the price of the item, then just take it off my order. Beverages you buy also had to be scanned. I wanted to pay cash but was told there was no cashier. I pointed to one of the employees what was written on the sign in the entry way but he said if I wanted to pay cash then I would have to pay in the bar.\n\nZatar and Revolution have quick change light menus on the same board so it becomes a bit difficult when ordering. I was able to ask one of cooks to assist me. The shrimp looked delicious and he helped me with the kiosk in ordering a bowl made with rice noodles, shrimp, my choice of broth, and 4 add ons of my choice. Once you pay your receipt is given a number that appears on a lit board. When your number turns from red to green then your order is ready. If you don't want to fool with the board then they can text you if you provide your cell number. \n\nSince most of the people were going for sandwiches I got my broth bowl fairly quickly. I must stress that although some things here may say \"vegan\" I was told \"vegetarian\" instead because things could be compromised. There's inside seating in the foyer outside market. All your plastic utensils and napkins are situated inside near the center of the market.\n\nI felt my rice noodles were under cooked and not very tender. The shrimp however, made up for that error. They were nice size and still had their tails on them. You get 5 of them in your bowl. The broth bowl was filled to the brim and did have a bit of a \"kick\" to it with the Thai chili sauce he put in it. The other vegetables were in there but they seemed to be mostly shavings.\n\nThis place does catering and they have a phone number you can call them for that service. I went to the bar area when I was finished to search out a restroom and began to chat with the bar lady. She told me that I could have eaten my meal in here since they have both tables set up parallel to the bar. She also told me the Oxford Bar starts their own meal service at 3 pm and is open until 10 pm. Since they had opened two weeks ago she told me there were becoming more popular at night. \n\nThere is no restroom in the bar area nor is there one in the market. If you need to use the facilities then you have to completely walk out of the market and what's left of the old food court down a long hall and you will find them. Expect to pay prices similar to the old Easy Street here but the nice thing is you don't have to tip here. My pho bowl came to $9.50 plus tax. Prices seem reasonable but I feel this place is going to be experimental. Once I get an opportunity to try some of the other concepts then I'll be able to advise my own recommendations. My meal was average to say the least and afterwards I was unable to locate my cook to let him know that noodles weren't to my liking.\n"}, {"author": "Nancy R.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-05-03", "description": "This first review is for Bar Oxford inside the Oxford Market.

Oxford Market is the latest eatery to open in the lower level of One Oxford Centre. It may have taken longer than expected to open, but it was worth the wait. My coworkers love it and given the crowds I've seen, so do our neighbors.\n\nOxford Market is a made-to-order, customizable food court featuring a total of five food stations. Each station specializes in something different, giving you a good range of lunch options to order from! Guests must place their order at a kiosk rather than ordering from the stations themselves. Most kiosks are at the entrance of the Market but a few are scattered inside it as well. Feel free to order from more than one station at a time, too! Just remember to grab a drink and snacks before ordering - these are located in coolers and stands throughout the market and need to be scanned as part of your whole order.\n\nSo what do the stations themselves have to offer? Piccola Italia offers pasta and pizza; Market Fresh offers a salad bar (note that you make and weigh your salads, versus the ordering process for the other eateries); Flame seems to strike the American comfort food vein with protein-based sandwiches and fries; and the other two stations (who I sadly cannot name off the top of my head - I'll have to add their names later) offer Thai-inspired cuisine and tacos. All made fresh, all made to order, all made based on what you want! Yum!\n\nIn the future Oxford Market hopes to host food trucks as \"travel chefs\" or chefs of the week.

It's largely unchanged over that span, with the same decor, menu, and wine list. The menu is Italian and limited, with a few simple meat and pasta choices, a couple of soup and salad offerings, and a limited but adequate wine list. Prices are kind of mid-level and service is usually prompt. The food is unremarkable, but up to the unchallenging standards of a corporate restaurant. Overall it's a safe choice if you're looking for basic, but not quite authentic, Italian food. With no authentic Italian competition in the suburbs, Bravo fills the void.

Mostly \"americanized\" takes on Italian dishes (remember there is no alfredo sauce in Italy).\n\nStarted out with an order of the fried calamari.  Not very tender, and most likely frozen and not fresh/chef prepared.  Ordered the house salad to go along with the entree.  It was a chopped salad with tomato, bacon, cucumber in a house dressing of creamy Parmesan.  If you are looking for any health benefits in a salad, don't order this one.  You could barely see any lettuce through the heavy cream dressing.  And any lettuce that was there was iceberg, which was mostly white in color and covered up by the dressing.  I should have snapped a picture to better describe it.  Not very good at all.  Maybe it would be better with just oil & vinegar instead of the heavy house dressing.\n\nMain course was from the new Imbriolo family recipe menu.  These consist of 4 spaghetti dishes.  They are all reasonably priced although once again not very authentic (Cacio e pepe would never have butter in it in Italy).  I ordered the spaghetti pomodoro and it was fairly tasty and as I said previously it was reasonably priced.\n\nDrinks were also pretty reasonable.    House wine and cocktails both $7 and under.  Service was very good and attentive.\n\nSo overall, I would give it a 4 star for service & pricing and a 2 star for food quality & menu selections/choices, thus averaging into a 3 star overall.\n\nI haven't been to Bravo in years.  It used to always be packed.  I realize this was a weeknight but it wasn't very crowded at all.  Seems like chains in this mode might be experiencing problems (Chil's, TGIF, Applebees, etc).  The menu has been slimmed down since the last time I visited and the new Imbriolo dishes are kind of underwhelming.  Still a decent value but probably not someplace I would seek out again as a destination for a special event or anything like that.\n"}, {"author": "Alan W.", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2017-10-23", "description": "Went here about a week ago.\nI decided to get take out and ordered a chicken parm with a side salad and spaghetti.\nWhen I called in the order they told me about 40 minutes minimum.\nI went around and did some errands and then came back about 20-25 minutes after ordering.\nI went in and the lady behind the counter was nice and was friendly.\nThe system for take out is not good at all.\nI walked in and the lady behind the counter had to get another person then that person came out and took my credit card.\nThey took credit card and disappeared into back and then came out with food and receipt.\nThe process from the time I walked in to the time I walked out was at least 10 minutes.\nThe food was already ready when I came in so it sat there getting cold while they where getting the payment thru.\nThey told me at least 40 minutes it was less than 25 if I would of come at the 40 minute mark it would of sat for 15 minutes getting ice cold and then the 10 minute ride home as well.\nNow for the food, I have too say the only good part of the meal was the salad.\nThe chicken part was not good and I did not like the taste of it also it was ice cold besides.\nThe spaghetti was cold and the sauce was not that good as well.\nI do not think I would ever go there for take out again as the system for take out needs a lot to be desired as well as they do not know how to estimate food prep time.\nI also noticed many negative reviews so I probably would not go back ever again.\nI do not recommend Bravo for take out at all.\n"}, {"author": "Nicole G.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-02-04", "description": "Don't skip this place!

Completely disgusting. There was urine on the floor. If I hadn't been so starving at the time, I would have walked out. We asked for bread (during previous visits, it was brought out after beverages) and the waitress said, \"oh you want it now?\" Which rubbed me the wrong way. I ordered the Chicken Scallopini and asked for her to leave the Chicken off of it because i don't eat meat. She made a confused face and asked me if I wanted something instead, but I didn't know what options I had, so I just asked her to add extra mushrooms to it. When I got my dish, it looked... sad. There were two whole portobellas laying beside some twirled pasta. The portion seemed small compared to my friend's spaghetti. As I cut into the mushrooms, I saw that they were scalloped horizontally, almost paper thin. I have never in my life seem a mushroom cut that way. I had many bites that were just stem. The mushrooms were also extremely undercooked. It was hard enough to find something to eat because they don't have vegetarian options other than salad and eggplant parm. (I don't like eggplant). I didn't return the dish because I couldn't bare to be there anymore. I will never go here again.

Was I ever delighted when it turned out that I was wrong.\n\nLooking for food after an exhausting day I was basically tired and found myself in front of here.  When I looked in the window I found a dining room with tables rather than a bar filled with people standing.  While looking in the window I also noticed daily specials.  These change from day to day.  So if you don't want something on the menu, you can choose one of the daily specials.  \n\nOn this particular night we went with the specials.  I went in and asked for a menu.  I was offered a seat, but I declined since I knew I was taking it with me.  After looking of the menu quickly I went with the specials.  I ordered the stuffed pork chops for my better half and then for myself I got the stuffed chicken breast.  While it was being prepared I was once again offered a seat and a drink.  I again declined.  Once the food was prepared I was surprised by the amount that came out, it was definitely a dinner.  Just so everyone knows, cash only.  If you don't have enough cash on you, there is an ATM inside to help you.\n\nOnce I got the food home I was floored.  The amount is overwhelming and will fill you up for sure.  You get a salad with your meal as well, and bread.  Two big slices of fresh Italian bread which accompanies your meal quite nicely.  I can't speak to the pork chops, but that chicken breast was huge and filled to the brim with some amazing stuffing.  Covered in gravy which gives you a nice blend of flavors.  The mashed potatoes were equally amazing and that gravy continued there.  The broccoli was great as well.  \n\nI can tell you that I cleaned my plate that night and had a happy belly.

My friend and I went here on a Friday for lunch when the weather was agreeable (by Pittsburgh in February standards) yet it was still half empty. Once people hear about this place, it's going to be packed because it's delicious and reasonably priced. Agree with other reviews, the only downside is the food is a bit slow to arrive. However I'd add that the fruit in the sweet crepe was so fresh that it was definitely prepped for our specific order so this helps explain the wait. We had the Bonjour and Super Veg savory crepes, and the de Paris sweet crepe with lattes. Everything was fantastic. Laidback and quiet atmosphere.

I would suggest ordering ahead if you can. There is limited seating - three tables for 4, one table for 2, two low chairs and tables and 4 individual seats against the wall. I ordered the chicken and mozzarella crepe and was told that it would take 20 minutes to make. I'm not sure why it takes so long, but there were 3 crepes before me. The waitress said that the paninis are much faster, but I couldn't pass up on a crepe. The table next me ordered at the same time and despite them getting a panini and a salad, our food came at the same time. So I think their food all just comes out a little slow, which is fine if you're coming for a leisurely lunch. \n\nNow onto the food. The crepe is wonderful, nice and thin. You can't beat the price, $7.99. The spicy sauce on top has a nice little kick, but since I'm a spice lover I will ask for extra next time. There isn't a ton in the Crepe but if you eat it with the salad, it's wonderful. Portion size is also good. \n\nSomeone posted that you order at the counter and pick your seat.

This place has been jam-packed ever since it opened late last year, so you would think it's gotta be pretty spectacular, right? Well, you would be wrong. I know Mad Mex is a Pittsburgh staple, so I was excited to see what all of the fuss is about. We decided to brave the crowds and try it out on a Wednesday evening (it was a 20 minute wait even during the weekday).\n\nMy key takeaway: this place seems to be all style and no substance. Sure, they have the funky decor and the sassy menu, but when it comes to the food, it's surprisingly disappointing. We started out with a trio of dips (cheese dip, black bean dip, and the fire-roasted chipotle salsa). Two of the dips were the highlight of our meal. The black bean dip and the fire-roasted salsa were awesome and very flavorful. The cheese dip, however, was an abomination to dips...it was very reminiscent of ballpark nacho cheese with some spices in it. Now, there's nothing wrong with ballpark cheese dip (well, actually, there are lots of things wrong with it, but that's besides the point), but Mad Mex charges close to $8 for their cheese dip, so I expect higher quality than that. \n\nAnd with the cheese dip, we began our disappointing descent into dinner mediocrity. My husband and I each got a burrito, which I thought they were supposedly known for. As far as I can tell, the biggest draw to their burritos seems to be that they're crazy big....but taste-wise? No bueno. The only word I can use to describe my burrito is \"bland.\" Bland rice, bland beans, bland chicken...oh, and add \"overcooked\" and \"dry\" for the chicken. The burrito was served with salsa on the side, but it was also pretty bland (the fire-roasted salsa we got in our appetizer dips was MUCH better than their original salsa that comes with their burritos). I gave it a valiant effort, but I made it about a third of the way through the burrito before I gave up and decided it just wasn't worth finishing. \n\nGiven how packed this place constantly is, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? But all I know is that we spent about $40 on chips and dip and two burritos at Mad Mex, when we could've gone three doors down to Chipotle and gotten more flavorful food for half the price. Back to Chipotle it is!\n"}, {"author": "David B.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2019-03-10", "description": "Dependably good.

My only gripe was that the margarita that my wife ordered was 80% ice, and the tequila was barely noticeable. She ended up asking for a Coke after she drank the thimbleful of liquid in that drink - we learned our lesson there, and the next time we go, we will spring for one of the \"signature\" margaritas and hope for a better pour.\n\nWe finished with the downright tasty hazelnut chocolate churros. These were stellar, as we expected.\n\nFood portions are pretty good.

I was reluctant because I regularly avoid Bravo at all costs due to previous visits taking hours out of my day for an 'okay' meal, but I was getting bored with the variety at the Waterfront, which my friend and I frequent regularly for our catch-up lunches every few weeks. I gave a half-hearted yes and decided to give them another try- we decided on 11AM as soon as they opened (that's a little late for brunch, no?) and were promptly seated. We had a movie across the street at Loews at 12:35 so of course this was more than enough time to eat brunch - not! We didn't get out of there until 12:15 and not because we were sitting and chatting after the meal, but the long wait for the food! More on that later...\n\nThe brunch menu has a decent selection of breakfast foods, a couple sandwiches, a couple types of pizza, a few entree salads, and quite a few pasta options. I decided on the Romano chicken salad but asked for grilled chicken instead of the breaded/fried chicken. It was delicious with chopped lettuce, chopped eggs, small pieces of bacon, Parmesan cheese (quite odd- you'd think they'd have Parmesan shavings or shredded Parmesan, but no, it's like the finely-ground Kraft Parmesan cheese from the shaker bottle); the Parmesan dressing was excellent, though I wish they tossed the dressing with the salad instead of giving cups of the dressing as it was quite thick. My friend decided on the egg white omelette that comes with a side of fruit salad. She really enjoyed hers as well. \n\nBack to the wait time-  I haven't dined at Bravo for years even though I live in close proximity to two locations (Galleria and Waterfront). IT IS SOOOO SLOW HERE. I just don't get it! As I mentioned, we got there at 11:00 on the dot, so there weren't many other people dining around us, and our food took 45 minutes, for an omelette and an entree salad! I think that is just crazy. To be fair,  I would expect that for hearty pasta dinners if the place is completely packed and it's dinner time, but not a mostly-empty restaurant at 11:00 in the morning! It is extremely annoying. I see that nothing has changed in the service department so I am still reluctant to go again. \n\nMaybe we'll meet again in a few more years, Bravo. And mostly for the bread and oil :)\n"}, {"author": "Lina B.", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2019-01-20", "description": "I ordered a salad with an addition of salmon and instead the waiter brought the salad with a dinner that included salmon.

She said you will have to ask the manager. Ok bring him over. Same response from him. We are just giving out wait staff a little break. I asked couldn't you just seat the customers and explain that you are busy. He said I didn't want them to get seated and then ignored.

We went for dinner yesterday and walked in a few minutes before my husband, since he was coming from work, and decided to grab a drink at the bar. I ordered a dirty martini and it was probably the best that's ever been made. The olives were \"real\" olives... Not polluted with salt. I ordered my drink \"extra dirty\" and it was made just that. $5 was not bad for happy hour. I have to give a shout out to the bartender, who was absolutely on her A-game and sweet as pie.

I love that they were able to steam it for us. And the sauce that went with it was outrageously tasty. The marinara was good too. I wasn't a fan of the bread, though. That dipping oil didn't really do it for me. Our dishes came out in a timely manner and were literally steaming hot. I asked for extra garlic in mine and boy, they did not disappoint! Not to compare, but when I go to Olive Garden and request extra garlic in my dishes, they look at me like I have 3 heads. \n\nThe booth we were seated in was super spacious and comfortable, as well. Our server was kind and attentive. Although we didn't save room for dessert, I wish we would have because I would have loved to try one of their options.

The waiter really did seem to know the menu well, or at least what to highlight to customers.

The ramen was more salty than I'm used to (maybe that was what they were going for, but I think I'm used to a richer, more porky broth). The chashu, which I was expecting to be the highlight of the soup, was really thin. I'm used to thicker cuts of meat in my ramen, and I think that it really did detract from the quality of the meal. The noodles were nothing to write home about. There were some green veggies in the ramen that I don't think were traditional Japanese veggies for ramen. \n\nThen we had mochi ice cream for dessert (he recommended again -- mango) and it was decent.

Ordered online (which I've done multiple times, with no issues) to get my food, to have it wrong, why say a pizza has tomatoes on it, then you get it and it doesn't? Why order loaded fries to get plain fries, and there was so much cheese on the pizza only the very top layer was melted all the cheese underneath was still in solid shredded mozzarella form that the entire thing just tasted uncooked. Our hoagie was smashed and soggy When called they said they would credit us loaded fries to my account.. needless to say, we spent $51 and change on pizza that we ended up not getting to eat because it was awful. \nIt hurts to say it but we probably won't be ordering again unfortunately .\n"}, {"author": "Jason F.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2018-07-08", "description": "I stopped by here earlier today with my wife for lunch.  We decided to come to Demores pizza because I had always wondered how it tasted since I drove by it a lot.  The cincher was whenever they put up a sign saying that one of the radio shows had voted it best pizza in Pittsburgh.  So we called up Demores Pizza at around 11:30 AM and ordered a 12 cut cheese pizza.  They let us know it would be about 20 minutes and it was ready for us whenever we got there about 30 minutes later.  Since we did takeout I didn't really pay too much attention to the restaurant and could only tell you there was a window into the kitchen where you could place and pick up orders and then a dining room.  The pizza itself ended up looking good with some nicely browned cheese and bubbled crust in places.  Like all pizzas this one can be broken down into its three major components: cheese, sauce and crust.  Starting off with the cheese, I think that there was an ample amount of it and it had a somewhat good taste to it.  Could it have been better?  Sure.  Was it bad though, nope.  Next up was the sauce which I honestly had a tough time trying to find.  I mean I know that it was there and I was trying to taste any spice or sweetness from it but got neither.  Last but certainly not least was the crust which was easily the best part of this pizza.  It was cooked well and had a nice bite to it with the outside being crispy and the inside warm and soft.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  While Demores pizza didn't exactly blow me away, it wasn't bad either and I did enjoy their crust.\n"}, {"author": "Jackie G.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-05-13", "description": "The best pizza hands down!

The only things we didn't like was that they could've added more cheese (Make sure you ask for extra) and the pepperoni was thin and cheap. I would've paid more for thicker better grade meat.

I've been to dozens of asian buffets and this is one of the cleanest. The wait staff was also exceptional; whenever I went to get another plate, the mess of the previous plate was also cleared before I got back. I had the chance to talk to Joy, who was so kind and amazing at her job. \n\nAt $16 per person for dinner, I think the quality and diversity of the food here is truly discounted. What I loved was that all the trays were small -- indicating that they make small, high quality batches at a time for each dish. Also, having smaller trays meant there were so many things to try! While we were there, I was particularly enamored with the blistered yet crispy green beans and they replenished that particular tray faster than I could eat them!\n\nThe other thing I really enjoyed was the crab. They literally serve half-crabs here and they are enormous, juicy, and addicting. I was amazed they served crab for only $16/person.

They make you feel at home and I like that better than all of the chains.\n"}, {"author": "Jason T.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2014-07-26", "description": "Sapporo is my favorite Japanese restaurant, period. I've found other places that come close, but for me, this is the place I like to spend my money when it comes to hibachi cuisine. \n\nSapporo is an unassuming place right next to Steubenville Pike's hottest tourist attraction, the Pittsburgh Motel. But don't let the location fool you. Step inside and enjoy a cozy atmosphere. There's a bar at the front, some tables to the right, and the main dining area to the left. There's also that karaoke machine I've never seen used in all the years I've gone here.\n\nUnlike other Japanese restaurants like Saga (great stuff) and Ichiban, the cooks at Sapporo aren't all about giving an extensive show while cooking. Each of the chefs have a few of the basic crowd pleasers, such as the knife and spatula toss and the onion volcano, etc., but really it's all about the food, which is fine by me. I do sometimes miss when the chefs toss the pieces of shrimp up in the air towards your mouth to catch, but only because no one ever likes to participate in that but me and it's fun to look like a goofball while trying, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nThe food here is excellent. They've introduced a new look to their menu recently. I don't know if they scaled it down, as I often always order from the same section. I did notice they have a couple of sushi options available. They used to have a full sushi bar, and you can still see that when you walk in, but I'm not sure if they're using it for anything other than just what's on the main menu, which would be a shame if so, as their sushi was always great and you could order it from a separate menu. Again, this may be something they still have that I'm not aware of.\n\nAt any rate, the starter soup and salad is great. I love the bits of onion in the soup. It's a very strong broth, but not overpowering. The ginger dressing on the salad is something you either like or loathe at any Japanese restaurant, and here I really love it, but I tend to like it everywhere I've had it, so I'm not a real stickler when it comes to that.\n\nUsually I order the filet mignon and shrimp with fried rice for my main meal, though last time I got the deluxe version of the dish which also includes lobster tail and ice cream for dessert. Either way, it's a great dish. I've also had the chicken and shrimp and have enjoyed it as well.\n\nNow, my favorite thing here is the shrimp sauce. I call it the \"magic sauce.\" It's of the light pink variety and thin consistency. I'm always disappointed when I go to other Japanese steakhouses and they either don't have shrimp sauce altogether or they have the thicker, mayonnaise-based version, which is OK, but doesn't come close to the awesomeness that is the magic sauce. Apparently it's a secret as to just what goes into it. On one visit our chef joked that its main base was strawberry Quik, which one of the fellow diners at my table believed.\n\nSo if you get the fried rice here, dump some of the magic sauce on there. It's amazing. Use it for your steak or chicken as well. I find myself doing that and then saving the darker sauce for my grilled veggies, which are also top notch here. Terrific grilled onions and ripe zucchini as well as mushrooms and broccoli. I don't care for broccoli personally, but the rest is excellent.\n\nSapporo has also started throwing in noodles to the mix. According to the owner this is because other restaurants started doing it, so patrons who came in started asking why Sapporo didn't have them as well. I think they were doing fine without them, as it just adds even more to an already large amount of food, but they are good, if unnecessary.\n\nThe steak here is great. I've had the sirloin as well as the filet. I always get mine cooked rare, and it is of the melt in your mouth caliber. The shrimp never taste fishy, and the lobster tail is similarly excellent. All around, you get a great meal here for the price.\n\nI'm not sure which nights are more crowded than not anymore. Sapporo's a funny place in that some weeknights you'll drive by and it's packed and then other nights it will be quiet. I'd suppose weekends draw the biggest crowds. Yet even when it was \"packed\" I've never had to wait long to be seated at a table.\n\nSo if you haven't been, give Sapporo a try. It's been there forever. The owner and staff are super nice and they really do care about serving you great food when you visit. They don't do lunches anymore, so it's strictly dinner meals, so be looking at spending at least 20-30 dollars on up for adults, and around 10 or so for kids' meals. It's not some place you would go frequently if you're on a budget, but that makes it all the more a treat when you do go.\n"}, {"author": "Christy B.", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2017-02-26", "description": "I'll be honest, the food is great.

The pizza had just enough of a punch to take it to a 3/10 on the average person's Scoville scale for the chicken and a 2/10 for the pizza overall. I'm not sure how I feel about the sauce.

I'm not a fan of pork to begin with and this was riddled with bits of it made me think twice about devouring it.\n\nJust because I had a poor showing with this the first time around, doesn't mean that I will the next.

Each of them placed their order from the menu while I opted for the Sushi Lunch Special consisting of 5 pieces of sushi and a California roll. That along with a drink was $12 and some change. Please keep in mind this was around 12:30p so the lunch hour. While each of my co-workers received their food and appetizer, I continued to wait for my lunch special. I had assumed since it was a lunch special that it was readily available. I was wrong. About 10 minutes after my friends had begun to eat ( which hey felt awkward doing in front of me with no food but I insisted) my dish finally arrived. The presentation was great and I must say the Sushi was fairly good. You could tell it was a rush job because the sticky rice wasn't holding very well and crumbled a lot. This certainly wasn't the best Sushi I've ever had but far from the worst and it is nice to know I have a place within walking distance from work. I was disappointed in the timing but over all pleased with the end result. I look forward to trying some of their specialty rolls which are buy one get one 1/2 off along with their more traditional dishes.

I order 2 rolls Spicy Girl and Ocean roll b/c it was buy one get one half off. And I must say they are pretty good. They didn't use a whole lot of rice and the fish taste pretty fresh. And as you can see from my half eaten plate it is presented nicely as well. The only real complaint I have is that the ginger and the Wasabi aren't that fresh. And I love ginger, so I was a lil disappointed. And also if you choose to sit down to eat don't expect a true waitress service, they bring your food and that's about it.

From the time we ordered until the delivery arrived, it was a fraction of what other places in Oakland will quote you.  This however makes you wonder just how the food is prepared.  If it will come that quick it makes you think that the food has been prepared prior to your order and has been sitting under heating lamps.  \n\nSpeaking of the food, I decided to order the chicken strips and fries.  I am not sure if this is an accurate description of the food, but the chicken strips were airy.  I am not sure how that happens, but it felt as if there was a ton of air once you bit into the strip.  Weird.  As for the fries, generic and frozen.  Lackluster can best describe my food and is one of the causes as to me not ordering from here again.  Another being the fact that the prices are a bit steep.  Compared to other pizza places that deliver in the area you would think competition would be in full effect here.  Nope.

It honestly doesn't seem to matter if we order right off the menu or if we ask for a small change to our order - something basic will always be missing (like lettuce) or done incorrectly when the food arrives. \n\nThen there's the fact that the order time really has slowed down, a lot - once we placed an order and nothing arrived for two hours. Sorry, but unless it's a major holiday that kind of wait for a sandwich is just too long. Most recently, it took an hour for our food to even get out the door (we know this because we called exactly an hour after ordering, and they said it was leaving then). Why couldn't they have warned us about this wait in advance? This is standard practice for other companies that deliver, is it not?\n\nThe final downgrade in service at Cafe are the problems with their phone and staff. I've been accidentally hung up on multiple times at this point; I've also heard people debating in the background about who needs to take our order when we're asked to hold, please. From the snippets of conversation we can hear, things definitely aren't running as smoothly at Cafe as they used to be. Of course this is just when I can dial through - it's not uncommon to try to dial in and be told that the call can't be connected for some reason. \n\nAll of this adds up to a more and more disappointing Cafe delivery experience.

But I feel like this waiter had resigned himself to the fact that he was just not going to give us good service. My food was brought out cold (and I was willing to look past that because like I said I do my best not to be difficult). My husband needed a second glass of water and was not offered one so he asked. Well, we waited and waited. The waiter finally remembered that we existed and asked if my husband needed a cup of water, to which he responded yes. We still never got that cup of water. Our bill was finally brought to us after the waiter disappeared for an extended period of time, and we had yet another wait to finally get checked out. It was just not a good experience. Please do better to be attentive to your guests. I get that it's hard to balance many things but at the least, make sure that your guests have something to drink while they eat their food.\n\nSummary: my food was cold, but it tasted ok.

Mainly because you can have whatever you want delivered to you, or call ahead and do a quick pick up on your way home.  Recently my better half and I were just not wanting to move and wanted to continue our lazy day.  We decided pizza would be a good go to.\n\nLooking up Cerasoli we made a quick decision and called to place our order.  We were told it would take about 20 minutes and our order would be ready.  Being close by that allowed for us to continue to be lazy and leave after a few minutes to get here when our food was ready.\n\nWe showed up here and had a few more minutes to wait, but that allowed for us to pay and check out the place.  It is a small pizzeria, but it does allow for eat in if you please.  There are a few tables inside, but I think that if you want to eat in house it might be best to do so in the colder months.  It gets rather hot in here.\n\nOur food was ready and we headed out.  We decided on the Meat Lovers Pizza and two orders of mozzarella sticks.  The mozzarella sticks were your basic item that you can get from any other pizza joint in the city.  Nice coating on the outside with a side of marinara for dipping.  The Meat Lovers Pizza was your almighty pizza.  This thing came topped with pepperoni, sausage, ham, salami, capicola, gyro meat, and bacon.  Also put some mozzarella, provolone, and Romano cheese.  This thing was massive.  Also with being massive, it was greasy to no end.  It made it a bit heavy, but in the end, filling.  I could only eat a few slices and had to stop.  Which isn't all that bad, that meant that I had some for later.

With a name that kind of evokes an Italian Mexican chain, it's not what you are really getting.  One of the other things that I really appreciate of this place is that they deliver to a huge amount of neighborhoods circling around the downtown area.\n\nSince I started out on writing my review for this place I have ordered at least twice from here.  Both times I was not disappointed.  Both times I was full.\n\nMy first order was one of their bread twists.  I had the pepperoni variety.  If you need a visual for this, just think of everything that you would put on a pizza, minus the sauce, stuffed inside some bread that is in the shape of a C.  Only minus the sauce on the inside, why, because you get a side of marinara on the side with some ranch (more on that later) on the side.  It was good, so good that I ate it all in one sitting.  \n\nMy next order here was a salad.  With a mix of iceberg and spring mix lettuce I wasn't let down by this.  Add in some cucumbers, red onions, and tomatoes I was sold.  I had opted for some of that ranch dressing I mentioned prior.  What is so good about it?  It's homemade.  So good, definitely not store bought.  I thank you for this due to my allergies, I could actually enjoy a ranch dressing again.\n\nYou've definitely earned another repeat customer in me.\n\n\nWoot Woot!

Right away I loved the decor---new lighting and wallpaper. \nThe menu looked similar to what Ease offered- just slimmed down. The kids menu is exactly the same from what I remembered. My daughter ordered the pasta and applesauce. I ordered the FPT burger - no bacon. It was REALLY good. The onion ring was a nice touch. My husband ordered the chicken sandwich and he had no complaints. \nWe ordered the seasonal fruit tart for dessert. I wasn't a huge fan. Not sure if I'm the best critic since I don't usually eat dessert. \nI'm really glad Frick Park Tavern opened finally. It is a good addition to the restaurants in the square.

I was nervous that since it was opening night the quality of service or food could be compromised and my opinion would be tainted but I'm happy to report that was not the case.  Frick Park Tavern is a great addition to Regent Square!\n\nThe decor was home-y but modern and was perfect for the space.  The atmosphere was inviting for couples, friends, and families.  They have a great selection of beer, wine and cocktails and their menu has something for everyone.  There are a lot of salads and sandwiches but a nice selection of entrees to help round out the menu and make this restaurant great for a casual dinner or a nice night out.\n\nWe started with the candied chili bacon and the fig and bleu tart.  The bacon is a must get and the tarts were good - I would have liked a little more bleu cheese but that is a personal preference.  I ordered the Nature Trail which was good but I would try something different next time.  My husband got the Pnkerton and that cocktail is a must try if you enjoy smokey cocktails.\n\nFor our main meals I ordered the double cut pork chop (after seeing a sneak peak video on their instagram) and my husband got Jimmy's Special Meatloaf.  The apple glaze was so good on the pork chop and it was cooked perfectly.  The cabbage and bacon risotto were perfect sides for the dish.

I think Ease was a great one at that and didn't need renovation, but here we are with FPT. So far it's been great. Below are my thoughts on the menu items.\n\nRestaurants with huge menu are an automatic fail IMO. FPT does it right in that regard. \n\nPan-Roasted Salmon: cooked and seasoned to perfection. \n\nCrispy Calamari: The squid pieces are small, so you taste more of the batter than squid. A little bland overall, and not really crispy. I do like the occasional fried pickle they mix in there that added some flavor.  \n\nFPT Salad: too much vinaigrette. I was a huge fan of their salad back when FPT was Ease. It was served in a big stainless steel bowl, well mixed with perfect amount of dressing. But the FPT salad was a letdown. Way too sour. I couldn't even finish it. Served on a plate so it's hard to toss the salad without accidentally dropping bits on the table. \n\nFPT Burger: Burger's top-notch. Even more impressive was the fries. Among the best fries I have ever had - thick and crunchy. Rosemary sea salt was a great touch.\n\nButtermilk Fried Chicken Salad: Great pairing. Chicken was tender and juicy; good salad. Portion was small for an entr\u00e9e but big for an appetizer, so I'd consider adding another protein option if for entr\u00e9e.\n"}, {"author": "Charlotte R.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2019-11-10", "description": "My first trip to FPT did not disappoint.

We tried the deviled eggs and cured vegetables which were delicious but $5 for one and a half eggs is a bit too much. The charcuterie board was definitely the low point with only 2 cheeses and a very minimal selection of salami - just one type and only a few slices and at that very overpriced but at least tasty. Entrees tried were meatloaf and pork chop - again delicious and satisfying if not a few dollars over-priced.  Our service was super friendly but definitely lagged at several points - waiting to order drinks and waiting to ask for the check (another server ended up coming by to ask us). The entrees were slow to come and did not get an update from the server. A different server who brought them out apologized for the wait and that at least was appreciated. Other than these few things it would have been 5 stars. We will absolutely be back - just won't ordered the apps we did. And trust that the service will improve after the opening week.

The pierogies are to die for, they also have a Polish platter, but many entr\u00e9e choices and burgers and cheese steaks and chicken sandwiches and the like. Their wings are full sized fried chicken wings not tiny buffalo wings and so they are huge. It seems all their appetizers are pretty large servings as are their entree meals as well. Last night I ordered a large cheese steak, but without the bun, it came in a bowl and I added lettuce and tomato so it was like having a giant steak salad with the steak grilled onions and mushrooms and peppers on the bottom and the salad on the top. It was delicious! I also had a house salad with that, and four diet Pepsi's and my total bill with the tip was only about $13. Alcoholic Drinks are not expensive.

Meh. I mean, it wasn't bad. But I think expectations were high given that they claim that this is their signature pie. The crust was pretty good...nice and chewy. But the pie itself seemed kinda dry. Maybe not enough buffalo sauce? The cheese wasn't particularly gooey, and the chicken strips on the pizza were also a bit dry.

It arrived with whole leaves of spinach (no problem there) and they gave me a *spoon* (very much a problem). A spoon to eat spinach, rice, beans, etc.  I ate my whole other taco (which was also bland) and started doing my best with the spoon before any waitstaff got close enough for us to ask for additional silverware and napkins. The rice was slightly undercooked, everything was pretty cold, and nothing had a lot of flavor. One of my tacos was supposed to have a spicy sauce on it--I couldn't tell which one.\n\nMy dining companions who ordered pizzas were also very disappointed, one remarking that a personal pan pizza from Pizza Hut was better. Those of use with tacos agreed that Chipotle is exponentially better than anything we had this evening. \n\n We were never asked if we wanted any more drinks. After sitting for some time, the server abruptly showed up with four separate checks, though she had never asked how we wanted the bill split. \n\nI am very sorry to say that I don't even see enough promise to warrant another trip to give them a chance to find their footing.\n"}, {"author": "Karla D.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2019-08-04", "description": "The concept of tacos and pizza in one place is brilliant I tell you.

I'm honestly shocked by the ratings thus far?

She forgot the chips & salsa we ordered, and we never saw her again until she brought our entrees. After we finished our food (well i didn't, my fianc\u00e9 did rather than waste), we waited about 10 minutes just to see her again to request our check. \n\nFood - for such a small size, the pizza can get expensive as you add toppings. We spent $40 for a pizza, 3 tacos, and 2 half off drinks. About $5 of which was just for some pepperoni (2x and hot sauce). The outside was charred, and not the good way. Tasted like a burnt dirty pan. The taste lingered for some time. The toppings were practically raw and there was an unknown cause of moisture/liquid.  The tacos were extremely greasy. \n\nDrinks - Both mine and my fianc\u00e9's tasted flat ? Just not cold or refreshing whatsoever. We both had drafts. \n\nAtmosphere -- strange and closed off. The booths are awkward. Wide and just uncomfortable wood. I think a picnic table would be more comfortable. Also the music is so bad. Though one positive is the range of TV show selection? One sports, one amc, one syfy, one food network, etc...\n\nI am not typically compelled to leave reviews but ugh...

Sadly, the cider/beer selection is the only thing we loved about the place. The chips starter is NOT FREE which is pretty different than any other Latin American ish place I've been to. Fine, whatever, we got their spiciest salsa and chips, which weren't anything more special than the free stuff at most restaurants, but again, whatever. Then we ordered tacos with pulled chicken and several toppings. They initially had the shrimp tacos listed as gluten free on the menu, but our server (thank goodness for her) told my gluten free not-by-choice partner that these were definitely breaded. Fine, so more chicken tacos were ordered. They came out finally and were....so sad. The chicken tasted like canned chicken at best, not pulled chicken. The flavors were flat, and the creamy toppings had no south of the border pizazz. This place rates in the worst 2 places I'd ever been for Latin American food. And it wasn't that cheap either.

It is a wonderful wedding venue, as my husband and I held our wedding reception here. An important thing to note, you don't need to be a member! The events coordinator is extremely helpful and very friendly, while the venue itself is incredibly accommodating. Our coordinator made the stresses of planning a reception so easy and enjoyable. Typically, food at weddings can be hit or miss since they prepare all the entrees at once. But the food at our reception was absolutely perfect: the filets were all a perfect medium rare! Our guests, to this day, tell us about how delicious the food was. Not only did we have our wedding reception here, we also had the rehearsal dinner at the Rivers Club. They reserved a board room in the back for our large party and it was perfectly intimate. We could socialize amongst ourselves without any distractions from other parties. Again, everyone loved the food! On top of great food, every member of the wait staff is incredibly friendly and patient. Customer service is top-notch here. \n\nWhen our one year anniversary came, we chose to dine here to celebrate. Again, nothing but praises for the chef(s) and wait staff. We reserved a table, thinking we'd just get a spot in the dining room with other club members, but they placed us in a board room with just the two of us; so romantic! On top of that, they took the time to print out \"Happy Anniversary\" cards and decorate the room with candles all throughout. AND! we received a complimentary chocolate cake with \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate icing. All this special treatment and we weren't even members of the Club!\n\nI highly recommend anyone getting married to hold their reception here. In addition, the dining room is open to the public. The Rivers Club, in my opinion, is one of the most underrated dining options in Pittsburgh. The Rivers Club really goes above and beyond to make you feel special.\n"}, {"author": "Don B.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2017-12-05", "description": "Had dinner with a large group.

We had reservations for a Friday night and whenever we arrived there was only one other table in the club.  Since the dining room is fairly cavernous, it was almost awkward.  As you would expect at a finer dining establishment the tables were covered in white tablecloths and there was silverware on the table for a number of courses.  We were sat near the windows which overlooked the Monogahela River and I imagine that the view would have been pretty great but since we were visiting at night in winter, there was not much to be seen.\n\nOur table decided to start off by splitting zucchini and ricotta fritters and the caprese kabobs while I also ordered the beer & 3 cheese soup since I thought that it sounded good.  The fritters were not completely what I expected but were really good and lived up to their name of fritters.  Meanwhile the caprese kabobs left a little to be desired as they were just some tomatoes and cheese on a kabob with a little balsalmic drizzle.  Finally my cheese soup was an interesting mixture.  I could taste the beer but it also tasted strongly of American cheese, you know the singles kind that you buy presliced at the supermarket?  So while I enjoyed it initially, by the end it sort of tasted like I was drinking a grilled cheese soup which wasn't the most appealing thing.  For my entree I went with the grilled lemon-basil chicken and rosemary shrimp while my girlfriend went with one of their specialties, the honey and lime swordfish.  Whenever our entrees came is when the service went from awkward to just plain weird.  I should say that all of dinner up to that point our server was very standoffish and made us feel uncomfortable.  Well she did not clean off our appetizers and plates before the entrees came even though we were finished with everything well in advance.  Since we were only at a 4 top, our table was fairly full and dishes and the first dish that she served she ended up hovering over one of my dining companions until he made room for the entree.  While I have made room for entrees on the table before, I don't know that I have ever seen anyone pressured into it by a server.  In any case I ended up thinking that all of the portion sizes for dinner were fairly small with none of them covering more than half of the plate that they were served on.  My entree still was decent as the lemon flavoring on the chicken was good even if my chicken was dry and rosemary always pairs well with shrimp.  My girlfriend ended up describing her meal as a piece of frozen fish stuffed onto a plate with none of the promised honey & lime.  Since she is not normally one to say bad things about food, boy am I glad that I did not get that. \n\nThe bottom line for me is that I really hope that I never come back here in the future.  The service that was provided was awkward and left me feeling uncomfortable and the food was nothing to write home about either.\n"}, {"author": "Robin A.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2013-11-11", "description": "We had our wedding reception here in September 2013.

The travelzoo certificate my friend purchased was for 4 people to receive an appetizer, entree and dessert each. The total was $109. We made reservations for a Friday night and made our way downtown. When I was finally able to find the Club (2 elevators and 7 floors later), I was suprised to see that the huge dinning room was almost empty. There was only one other table dining. When we sat down, the maitre d informed us that with the travelzoo certificate, we would have $129 to spend for the table. We wer quite confused and taken aback by the fact that the certificate clearly states 4 appetizer, 4 entrees and 4 desserts but instead we were told that we would have a $129 credit instead. We looked over the menu, did the math and realized that 4 apps, entrees and desserts would be well over $129. when we explaied our disappointment to the maitre d, he first stated that there was nothing he could do and later offered to buy us a round of drinks. We obliged and carried on with our meal. The waitress picked up on our dissappointed but did not apologize or try to help. Rather, she talked to us as little as possible making the entire evening very awkward. \n\nAs for the food, we ordered the zuchini and ricotta fritters and the caprese kabobs. The fritters were excellent and kabobs were very good as well. Both appetizers were large enough to share. My dining companion also ordered the beer cheese soup as an appetizer. He really enjoyed the flavors. For my entree, I ordered one of the specials- chicken pesto. I found it odd that my enree came with a salad but the rest of my dining companions did not get a salad. The entrees were fairly small. They covered about 50% of the plate. My chicken was seasoned well but was rather dry. My husband also felt his chicken dish was slighlty over cooked. For dessert, my husband and I split the chocolate cake. Again, nothing special. Overall, the table felt that the food was good but small portions. However, we were all disappointed that we puchased a specific deal that they did not honor.\n"}, {"author": "Ricardo T.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2011-11-13", "description": "Excellent meeting facilities.

I'm not really a big fan of Moio's in Monroeville and I had, had Oakmont Bakery cakes every year for a while now. \n\nThen I remembered Eadie's Catering & Market in One BNY Mellon Center and how good their cakes were. They offer everything from basic cakes, cheese cakes, brownie or cookie cakes to specialty cakes and even specialty pies. I got my hands on a cake menu and made my order a few days before my big day. I went with the Raspberry Delight Specialty Cake (White cake with white butter cream icing and raspberry filing between the layers of cake.) \n\nOMG!!!

With this morning being on the wet side, I decided to cut through One Mellon Center on my way from my truck to the office and while doing so I discovered this little market. They've got a little self-serve buffet set up along the back of the market with breakfast items such as bacon, sausage, cheesy eggs, home fries, hash browns, quiche and breakfast sandwiches and burritos.  \n\nI helped myself to a modest helping of eggs, home fries, three strips of bacon and a cup of coffee which all came to $7.34... a bit steep I thought for a basic breakfast to go. But the eggs were delicious, the bacon was done just the way I like it (a little chewy and not too crispy) and the coffee was fresh.  My only complaint about the food was that I thought the home fries could have been cooked a little longer.  They were missing that brownish quality that I look for in home fries.  It would also be a nice touch if they offered sausage gravy. If sausage gravy was available and the home fries were a little more done, I would be there every morning and this would be a five star rating.\n\nThe cashier I dealt with was courteous yet efficient -- qualities you look for when you pick something up to eat before work.  \n\nAlthough it's a bit pricy for a breakfast, I can see myself stopping in here a couple of times a month for a morning treat.\n"}, {"author": "Lindsay J.", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2018-02-01", "description": "Prices are skyrocketing and quality is dropping.

Yummy breakfast sandwiches and pastries in the am, and lots of lunch options for the pm. Chicken tender day draws big crowds so you know those are good.

The lines can build up but they have you out of there in no time. \n\nThe thing that I do not like about Eadies has less to do with food and more about money, and that is my reasoning for 4 stars. There is a $5 minimum on credit/debit card purchases and I really hate that.  (btw, for a while I swear it was $10 min, but the last time I was there it was $5, so I updated my review)  The prices are a little steep and I wish I could use my card for all purchases since I don't usually carry cash.

The atmosphere is very nice and causal. There is a dining room on the one side and bar/lounge on the other. \n\nWe ordered several different things and I got a chance to taste everyone's plate except for the lasagna but it looked good and very cheesy. For appetizers, we had the Fried Zucchini w/ Marinara Sauce. It was great! Everyone at the table's tastes buds were leaping up and down.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Marsala and side pasta with meat marinara. That was ehhhh....ok. It's not anything that I would return for. And the meat sauce, you could barely tell there was any meat in there.\n\nSo here is why I really gave them 4 stars and will be back, the Shrimp Fettuccini Alfredo. I wanted to order it but was hesitant because there is nothing more infuriating than messed up Fettuccini Alfredo. I tasted my brother in laws and then I was mad that I didn't order it. HAHA! It was the right flavoring and consistency. There were only 4 shrimp but they were big. My brother in law was not satisfied with the amount of shrimp however the portion of Alfredo was huge, but he ordered more shrimp. My sister had the same as me but with Parmesan Risotto.

The server and manager disingenuously claim that state liquor laws prohibit bringing wine into the restaurant, but even the severely uninformed know that isn't true. \n\nApparently the owners have not noticed that all American sit-down restaurants sell or encourage table wine consumption. You can get a good glass or bottle of wine at all of the fast casual restaurants that infect the interstate highway interchanges as well as at the oxymoronic upscale burger places. In Silvioni's defense, they obviously have a number of satisfied repeat customers. However, to paraphrase Alice, there surely are a large number of un-customers who, like me, could be converted to customers if they could get a good glass of chianti to wash down that pasta. \n\nArrivederci Silvioni's.

I've been to several restaurants around sporting venues and I've never encountered one that suspended their happy hours because of a game or offered no specials whatsoever. \n\nThey were out of guacamole and the frozen margarita machine was broken.

They didn't bother to ask us what sides we wanted and when we did finally get food it was cold and bland. When it was all said and done the tickets were not right. \n\nThe only reason this place is open is because it's at the stadium.

I thought the guacamole was bland and the queso was ok, however resembled more of a beer cheese than a queso. I ordered the shrimp tacos and thought they were pretty tasty. The sides, though, were an embarrassment. My sides of rice and beans came in little cups that you typically get condiments in, which might not even be so bad if the platter everything came on weren't so large, highlighting exactly how small everything was.

We were here from 1-2pm and there was a high traffic of people throughout that hour waiting for the gates to open. The great thing though is that not only do they have seating inside of the restaurant, but they also have seating outside.\n\nOur stop here was brief, but we ordered 2 appetizers while we were here - The Traditional Guacamole and Nachos with Beef. Unfortunately, both appetizers were very disappointing. First, the Guac. The Guac appetizer came with a lot of tortilla chips, but the amount of Guac for it was very small. We were quite surprised at how little Guac was in the bowl, if you can call it that. In addition, the Guac lacked flavor and we had to salt it on our own to give it a little kick. The Nachos with Beef wasn't that much better. Once again, there were plenty of chips on the plate, but the lack of beef was disappointing. Some of the beef and ingredients were on the bottom, but the spread of the ingredients on the tortillas was still not as much as we would have liked. If anything, we enjoyed eating the chips with the Chohula Hot Sauce on the table more than we did with the Guac or Beef!\n\nThe critiques don't stop with the food though. The service wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. The waitress we had seemed semi-friendly, but we felt she checked up on us way too much constantly asking if we needed something else. In our 1 hour there, she probably came back to ask the same question about 5 times. We ordered 2 appetizers because we felt 1 would not have been enough monetarily with the both of us at a table, but the waitress was a bit too aggressive coming back to our table over and over again. Sometimes waiters/waitresses don't give enough attention, this was an example of TOO MUCH. Just when we thought she came by too often, when it came time to pay, she was no where to be found. I gave her my credit card, but she ended up going to other tables to take down orders and didn't return until 10-15 minutes later.\n\nI hate saying these things about establishments, but the truth is the truth.

There was a change in management maybe 1-1.5 years ago and you can really tell. The staff are now a little rude, and incredibly slow. You can have one person in front of you in line and you will definitely be waiting at least 5 minutes. Today I had the worse experience here and this is probably it for me. You can get much better bagels at Redhawk even if you can't get sandwiches.\n\nWhen I went in today, it was busy, and I was waiting a bit. A staff member came in from outside and jumped right in to working. He didn't go in the back to wash his hands at all. Then he proceeds to stick an entire finger in his mouth and tried to grab gloves to start my order. When I asked him if he was going to wash his hands since he had his fingers in his mouth, he just responded \"I know. That's why I'm putting on gloves\" with such an attitude. \n\nI should not get a nasty attitude for asking someone who just had their fingers in their mouth right in front of me to wash their hands. This is completely unacceptable. I would definitely not recommend this location to anyone.\n\nEDIT: The manager did call me about my feedback and was upset by the situation. She said she would deal with it immediately. I was asked if I wanted anything free, but turned that down.

Never have I ever walked a more consistently inconsistent Brueggers than this one. \n\nToday when I came in, it was the cashier who initially took my order, then handed it off to one of the workers on the line. This is where my order may have gotten lost. Since everything gets rung up at the end, there is no real system keeping track of what was ordered (including any modifications and allergies), making it easy to mess things up. The toasted asiago bagel with onion and chive cream cheese I ordered then became an untoasted cinnamon bagel with onion and chive. Ultimately I had to toss my entire bagel since I was already at my destination and could not get it remade.\n\nThe real issue here is the lack of a proper ordering system and a reliance on verbal communication between workers. If I had any real allergies (like a nut or dairy allergy) I would not trust this place to handle it. \n\nIf you like weird bagel combinations and living life on the edge, this location is for you.

Their food is top notch. There are 5 dishes by which I judge a Chinese restaurant: Wonton-Eggdrop soup, Moo Goo Gai Pan, Curry Chicken, Pepper Steak, and Lo Mein. I have so far eaten 3 of these dishes (The soup, the lo-main, and the curry chicken) and each dish gets 5 stars. First, most chinese restaurants in the area don't even have Wonton-Eggdrop soup (they have one of the other). Not only do they have it, but they have the big wontons like I am used to (and they're very yummy). The lo mein (I had chicken lo mein) was perfect - very flavorful and not too greasy as can be typical of some lo meins (theirs was more \"saucy\" as opposed to greasy. Finally, what I liked best was the curry chicken. I won't name names of other restaurants in the area, but let's just say I don't like watery sauces. Their curry sauce was very NOT watery, it was thick and delicious and they made it the way I like it, not too hot. In my dotage, my stomach has come to get very angry with me when I order food too spicy, although my mouth totally is on board (Sorry if that makes me a huge p@@@y, I am what I eat, get over it.) Anyway, I highly recommend this restaurant. Just a couple of minor things - I didn't get any fortune cookies with my lunch (not sure if this is standard or they just plain forgot) and I'm used to 8 wontons in a quart of Wonton-Eggdrop soup but they give only 4 (however, the wontons ARE big and the quart of this soup is fairly inexpensive, I am sure they'd give 8 if you pay a little more.) These two things are by no means a reason to avoid this restaurant that serves up delicious Chinese food!\n"}, {"author": "Beth E.", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2019-06-02", "description": "This was my first time ordering and only because my usual place is closed on Tuesdays.

The restaurant wasn't busy so I have no idea where she was.  When we did make our order of the sushi/sashimi platter, the waitress asked us \"y'all do know that's raw fish right?\" I was absolutely dumbfounded. If your employees don't understand that raw fish is a totally normal staple of Japanese cuisine, and that this is common knowledge, they should not be your employees. Despite that, the food itself was good, if not spectacular.\n\nTonight we went back to give Yokoso another try. It was a busier night, so we forgave the waitress for being slow to greet us and take our order of the sashimi platter.  The server didn't say anything offensive, so that was a relief.  When we got to the salmon sashimi, we noticed that it was still frozen solid. We had saved the salmon for last since it is usually our favorite, so we didn't bother complaining.  Blatantly frozen fish is a massive no-no when it comes to sushi.  Our complaint wouldn't have changed anything if the restaurant was willing to serve frozen fish in the first place.  \n\nAfter our meal we were still a little hungry and didn't know why until we realized that our server did not bring us the soup and salad that was supposed to come with our meal.  We were not vigilant and the restaurant took advantage of that.  We also tried ordering the sea urchin sushi out of curiosity, and apparently the restaurant has never had sea urchin. Why put it on the menu then?

Very fresh due to the amount of business it generates . \n\nThe shop is full of character, starting  with the seasoned employees, the various walks of life who stop in for their \"regular \" pizza by the slice order.\n\nTake out only.

It's affordable, quality food and better than takeout (but you can order pick up here). Every time I've been here I've had impeccable service. I've even met the manager who stopped by our table to check on us on one or two occasions. They care about food, flavor, and the experience and I can tell. The menu has a variety of oriental food for you to enjoy. When I first started coming here I was basic with my order of shrimp fried rice and now I venture off into other things. My new favorite is their Korean inspired Bibimbap. As someone who's tried it from an authentic Korean restaurant, I love their American style version. My only gripe is it's on the lunch menu only. I don't like eggs but the cracked egg totally makes the Bibimbap pop. My second favorite is their Kung Pao Shrimp. They know how to utilize spices and ensure that the flavors are married and not fighting. Their happy hour menu is something to smile about and their drink menu is merry. For my birthday this year I tried their egg roll dessert and it was surprisingly delicious. If you can fit room, do get an egg roll. You won't regret it. I have no complaints about this place. It's a good value.

I ordered the Ahi Poke Bowl--Never have I ever had such a horrible lunch...it was about 1 ounce of ground up tuna (just like you'd put in a spicy tuna roll)--a huge pile of ginger slices, 3 pieces of mango and 4 huge pieces of avocado, with the nastiest seaweed salad I've ever had, and some wonton chips, with dressing on the side.  I don't even know how you eat this correctly...everything was cut in disproportionate pieces, that couldn't be put on the chips.  It looked nothing like the picture on the website.

The chicken was a little crispy and they gave you a bit of sauce over the rice.  It had a good taste but there was some heat in that dish.  I have had their Honey Chicken here before and it's always been mild.  I'm not sure if maybe it was cooked in the same oil as a spicy dish made before the Honey Chicken but it carried spice.  The rice helped to take the bite off of the heat but I drank a lot of water trying to tame the burn in my mouth.  The others with me ordered spicy bowls and enjoyed them.  They looked amazing.

I live in the Banksville area and have been searching for a decent place for Chinese takeout for years. Particularly, my wife and I have been searching for a restaurant with ample, fresh veggies (with rice and brown sauce or with lo mein) and crisp, tasty tofu. I called Tong's for the first time without referencing a menu and simply described what I was looking for over the phone. They said, \"Yep, we can do that\" and then told me it'd be ready in 20 minutes.\n\nI got there and it's as unpretentious as the reviews say. A regular walked in behind me and asked where the kid was and apparently he was in vacation in China. While waiting for my food (I was early), I perused the menu and noticed that what I had ordered (mixed veggies w/ brown sauce and an order of General Tso's tofu) didn't exist on the menu. I was charged a reasonable amount in spite of this and it turned out pretty good. Not my favorite tofu to date (Mandarin Gourmet downtown wins that) but definitely satisfied my craving. Vegetables were also very, very good. They included zucchini, carrots, broccoli, onions and other good stuff without the typical \"filler\" veggies that you find at cheaper places. With that being said, this place was a buck or two cheaper than everywhere else I've tried in a 10 mile radius. \n\nBottom-line: Best Chinese restaurant this side of the tunnels.

We started with steamed veggie dumplings, sort of the low point.The dough was quite thick and heavy - BUT they were large and filled with a very tasty blend of veggies. Trimmed the extra dough off and they were gobbled up!\n Moved on to the main dishes - Szechuan beef (lots of veggies, great taste, tender beef), Dragon and Phoenix (tender chicken, shrimp, lots of crisp veggies) which was a little bland but very good taste, and veggie fried rice (plenty of fresh veggies with maybe some frozen peas and carrots) - again very tasty. We were struck by the amount and freshness of the veggies, the tenderness of the chicken and beef, and the low amount of oil used. Potions were plenty large (leftovers for lunch), food sat well with everyone, and the prices were good. I wish they had brown or similar rice but only white rice is available.

The chips were fine--it's hard to mess those up.  And, I have a mixed review for my mixed platter.  The refried beans were delicious.  The taco was edible, but unremarkable.

No mention of green peppers.  Needless to say, they were absolutely filled with green peppers.  More peppers than chicken.  I've never had a chimi with peppers in it at all.   My little daughter wanted chicken nuggets and fries.  They were out of nuggets so we ordered a chicken and cheese quesadilla instead.  When it came out and she took a few bites, there wasn't a piece of chicken to be found.  Add to that no refills, and forgotten ketchup packets, and it was a less than stellar experience.

But it's solidly average, it's close to my house, and sometimes I'm wildly lazy and don't feel like trekking far to stuff my face with copious amounts of free chips. So I keep slinking back to Patron for an adequate but not outstanding meal.\n\nThe first few times I went here, I sampled several chicken dishes that had their shredded, seasoned chicken in them (e.g., chicken flautas, chicken enchiladas). I found the texture of the shredded meat to be tough, stringy and chewy -- very off putting. So I started steering clear of anything with the shredded meat, and now I usually get their \"pollo amigo\" entree, which consists of chicken breast strips over a bed of rice topped with their cheese sauce. It's fairly tasty (the meat in this dish doesn't have any texture issues), although they could stand to be more generous with the cheese sauce. It's not overly spiced or flavorful, but it's generally decent (and that's pretty much how I would describe everything I've ever eaten here -- decent but not amazing).\n\nService can be hit or miss depending on what section you're in. I've always been seated right away (it's rarely busy in there), and free chips and salsa have always been delivered to our table with haste.  But beyond that, you can't always count on your server to promptly take your order, fill your drink, or check up on you with any regularity. It just really depends on the day.\n\nGiven the food quality and service, I think that they are probably priced on the high side.

Thai Hug is located across from Children's Hospital in Lawrenceville.  I felt the need to disclose that when we made the mistake of thinking it was right off of Butler and an easy walk from a local brewery.  It's not and nor was the walk especially on a humid August day.  Once we got there we settled into the ghost town restaurant for some dinner.  \n\nAs usual we ordered the fresh rolls.  I love fresh rolls often called summer rolls.  They serve two to an order for $6.00.  I was somewhat disappointed that they didn't include a protein with the rolls as most every other place will and they serve them whole.  I prefer pieces as opposed to eating it like an eggroll.  The roll lacked flavor, very minimal herbs mostly lettuce served with an overly sweetened peanut sauce.  I requested my usual Thai paste to improve the flavor and spiciness of the dish.  WOW.  I honestly don't think I have ever had anything hotter in my life!  I immediately began coughing, something I never do.  Even my husband said I have never seen you cough before!  It was spicy times 100.  I was very impressed and regardless of my tearful expression I found myself going back to it over and again.\n\nNext we ordered pork belly steamed buns also $6.00 for two.  Yes! Order these.  Delicious flavor.  The buns were perfectly soft and the pork was fatty and savory served with a cucumber slice to balance the richness and hot sauce to bump the heat.  I really enjoyed the composed flavors of the buns.  \n\nFor my entr\u00e9e I went with the Pad Kee Mao with Tofu.  This is my go to dish at Thai restaurants.  I love, love, love, the fat wide rice noodles I just can't seem to order any other entr\u00e9e simply because if it isn't broken don't fix it.  I decided to go with a spice level 8, being a little timid since feeling the burn of their chili paste.  8 ended up being too mild, so I used some of the extra chili paste to kick it up a notch.  Well that did the trick!  The flavor was pretty good, the noodles were not the best.  Not overcooked but choppy.  Not those long fat ribbons I look forward to.  The big disappointment came with my tofu.  Just spongy wet tasting tofu.

We had both been to Duke's before a long time ago but only for drinks.  So whenever we found it in the Enjoy book, we decided to give the food a try as well.  Whenever you first walk into Dukes you immediately enter into the bar area which has a bar and some high top tables.  Then much like a split level house, there are dining rooms both a half level down and a half level up from this area.  The bottom half (where we were seated) has a lot of exposed brick as well as some Pittsburgh sports memorabilia and some large TVs.\n\nFor dinner on this evening I decided to get the smothered chicken and chose sides of sweet potato fries and a side salad.  The side salad came out first and was your usual iceberg lettuce mix with red onions, cucumber and croutons.  It was an alright side salad but as you probably guessed with the mention of iceberg lettuce, somewhat tasteless as well.  Once my wife and I had both finished our salads our meals came out.  The first thing about my meal that I noticed was that it was garnished with a green leaf and an orange.  Wow talk about 80s garnish!  Honestly there isn't anything inherently wrong with that other than the fact that my green leaf was somewhat wilted and made for a not very appetizing appearance.  As for the rest of my meal, it looked good with the cheese, peppers and onions smothering the chicken.  However the chicken was maybe a half of a breast and I would have liked more of it.  Still it tasted pretty good as it had a grilled flavor to it and I enjoyed the cheese and toppings with it.  The sweet potato fries here were decent too and I liked that you were able to pick them as an option, even if they were a $1 up charge.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.

I was pleasantly surprised. The last time I ate at an Eat'n Park, I was not impressed. I got breakfast, and it was not good at all. The bacon was flimsy, toast was barely toasted, eggs over cooked, and it took forever to get a refill on my orange juice. When I went here yesterday, my breakfast was really good. I got two eggs over easy, some toast, bacon, and hash browns. The hash browns were fried, and obviously ordered in frozen and not made fresh, but they were oddly good. My eggs were cooked perfectly. My toast was nice and toasty and buttery. My only real complaint is how small the pieces of bacon were. The bacon was excellent, but you only got 3 very small pieces. Bummer. The only other thing I did not like about coming here was waiting a little while for someone to come towards the front to seat us. We waited over 5 minutes before the hostess came to seat us. Overall, I'm impressed. This breakfast definitely outweighed my expectations! I'll have to come back here and try their lunch and dinner menu items to see if they're any good or not.

It's just that good.\n\nEspecially during strawberry pie season, another one of their absolutely delicious options, ask for strawberries on your waffle.  The salad bar is always a good option, there's lots of stuff up there to choose from-it's also available as an option to add to any meal as a side.

A popular chain restaurant in the Pittsburgh region, you can expect a short list of lackluster reviews for these types of restaurants. \n\nHowever, when I decided to grab a quick lunch with my (small) immediate family of 13 members with 5 children under 6 (yikes!), and was provided with such great customer service, I feel I have to give a good shout out for this location. \n\nYou can imagine all the good ole stink eyes, sighs, and raised attitudes of hostesses and fellow eaters as a group this size with \"well behaved children\" enters the restaurant, right? But to the contrary, we were greeted with warm personalities and smiles. :-)\n\nA great feature of this location is that they have a separate room that can fit, I say, about 30 people that can be closed off from the rest of the dining area. Luckily for us, it wasn't being used at the time of our arrival and we were quickly seated in about 5 minutes! (Nice, right?) It also looks like this location has been recently renovated and it looks fresh, clean, and new.\n\nOur waitress, simply put, was a miracle worker and a friendly character with the kids. I was pretty impressed with the wait staff and their welcoming attitudes here. It provided a happier atmosphere for everyone. \n\nYou get the quality of food for what you pay for at Eat n Park. For our entire group, it was around $100, which is awesome! For myself, I go for a fresh salad and a hot cup of soup from the salad bar for my meal. \n\nMy only complaint here, and I was originally going to give 4 stars instead of 5, is that they were missing and running low on some important choices from the salad bar. You can't make a salad (from a salad bar) if you don't have any lettuce! :-/ Unless you're boycotting leafy greens for some reason. Fortunately, in a quick swoop, the lettuce replenisher saved the day and we were all able create the salads of our liking. I justified the quick feet and replenishment of the workers to give it the 5-star rating.\n\nThey say Eat n Park is the place for smiles, and I definitely walked out with a smile on my face. (Don't forget about the smiley cookies!) They provided heart shaped shaped ones for February. I'd say pick one up to share with someone you love, but let's be honest... you may want to grab two, because you're going to devour it. ;-)\n"}, {"author": "David A.", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2018-03-10", "description": "Surly, surly, surly drive-in window employees.

Sadly, that was the only good part of my experience.\n\nLet me start by saying I have been a bartender, server and chef for a long time and have managed and have been a trainer in each position.  I went in not expecting serve from the left, clear from the right, high - end dining.  However, service was definitely not what should be acceptable in a casino.\n\nI asked for a wine / drink menu and was told, \"those are hard to come by\" and after our server found one on the adjacent table, was told, \"I can never find one so quickly.\"  (The badly used small menu was definitely beat up, not wiped and was falling apart).  I asked the server the name of the 6 offered house wines and then had to explain twice that I was asking about the brand and not the varietals.  She had to go ask.  In the time she was gone, we decided to get a bottle of Woodbridge White Zin.  (Not my first choice, but my folks like white zin).  During this time, the initial drink order arrived after far too long a time.  When we finally received the wine, there was no bottle service presentation at all.  The foil on the top was very improperly cut as the foil was still above the upper lip on the tip and half under the upper lip with the cork re - inserted into the bottle.  So, the dirty blade made contact with the bottle glass that wine was being poured over.  As I ordered the bottle, I should have been given the first taste.  Nope.  She poured my glass, my father's glass and finished with my mother's glass.  Obviously, she should have been the first pour.\n\nOh, let me backtrack and say that the Woodbridge bottle I ordered was not the open bottle we received.  We were given a pre - opened bottle of Beringer that was $11 more expensive.\n\nOrdering our meals took a very long time from initial seating.  When we asked the soup of the day, our server had to go back and check.  The three of us ordered wedding soup.  On 2 of the plates, the soup had spilled over making the spoons and cracker packages sticky.  Also, it was the first wedding soup we have ever had with no chicken and no veal / meatballs.  It was pretty much chicken noodle without chicken.\n\nAgain, the saving part of the visit was the quality of the entrees.  Also, if proper wine presentation is not standard at your location, it should be utilized.  I have had bottles in different level restaurants in different casinos in and out of Pennsylvania.  It seems a universal standard.... especially when you are presented the wrong wine.\n\nFilled out the online form and still have not heard anything back.

When the burger came the patty was unevenly made so some bites you got a nice bite of beef and some the patty was thin. My burger was well done-no pink to be found.

I hoped it was a one off strange event since I never had a problem before and had ordered an average of every other week over a period of a year.

When I told them that they had delivered successfully many, many times in the past and that I don't know what happened last time and that I was hoping \"we could get over that as just a one time oddity\" they basically hung up on me.

When the salad arrived, the dressing was missing.  A very important key ingredient to any salad is the dressing.  With me being at work and on a limited amount of time to consume my salad on my lunch break, I had to rummage through the work fridge for some type of salad dressing to top this off.\n\nFrom the description on the menu you are to receive a handful of fries along with all the other ingredients for this salad.  If they consider this a handful of fries, I consider that they have a two year old working there.  I counted, and there were no more than eight total fries on this salad.  The breaded chicken was actually good.  It appears that they may make it on site (I cannot confirm this), but is was lightly breaded.  Not like the chicken tenders at most other restaurants.  Easily the best part of the salad.\n\nOne other shining star to this salad was that they give you a pita on the side instead of bread.  Giving you the option of putting the salad in the pocket and eating while doing other tasks.  But it wasn't shining enough to give this place more than two stars in my opinion.\n"}, {"author": "Greg C.", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2016-01-25", "description": "I've heard good things about Campus Deli and I was excited to try them when I was visiting Oakland.

Tons of cheese (I didn't order extra cheese), greasy, good seasoning & all around flavor. The cheesy bread was amazing too! \n\nSounds awesome right? Not so fast. Their website says 45 minutes for delivery. It took about an hour. Have ordered  from here about 7 times & only once, has it been on time. But hey, great food is worth the wait right?\n\nSure, if it stayed great. The second time I ordered a pepperoni pizza with extra cheese. Yum?! And some cheesy bread. OMG hope it gets delivered fast! Haha. Nope like 15 minutes late. And guess what? It was horrible. My \"extra cheese\" had less cheese that the first pizza I ordered. There was like no seasoning, and it was ice cold. The cheese bread was under cooked, lacked flavor, and had a strange aftertaste. (Never figured out what the taste was). It looked great, but it was horrible. Think most of my $20+ order went in the fridge, then to the garbage can. Ordered zucchini on one of my orders. Not sure which one, but it was a greasy mess. No seasoning, no parm, overcooked, almost completely burnt, with no flavor. Disgusting. \n\nBack on a positive. I'm a ranch fanatic. I LOVE the HOMEMADE Ranch dressing but it is not worth 75 cents for a half filled tiny tiny ( I STRESS TINY!!!!)  cup of it. Once when I ordered the homemade ranch they sent non homemade buttermilk ranch. Was so mad being I payed for 75 cents each for 3 & they went straight in the garbage.\n\n3rd time I ordered, I just got a pizza. Late delivery, ice cold pizza. Overcooked, not much cheese, no seasoning, no flavor. Edible, but not good.\n\n4th time. Same as above. \n\n5th time, same as above except the food came on time! I think even 5 minutes early, and was still hot. not much cheese, no flavor, no seasoning. Just eh.\n\n6th & last time. Late delivery, cold pizza. Mediocre, edible, nothing to brag about. \n\nNo idea what happened but I'm very disappointed. That first time I ordered it was amazing. It still wasn't a (mineos) but it was great food. Every time since, has sucked. Seems they got rid of the garlic salt & w/e other seasonings they used. \n\nI probably will order from here again at a last resort. They deliver to my house, I can order online, and that's about the only reasons besides hoping it will once again be like it was the first time I ordered. It will be a good while before I order though. Preferably never but we will see.\n\nFrom what I see, they seemed to have had a Grand Reopening from failing before? Not sure if that's true but I don't see them surviving on the food they have been providing. \n\nIm hungry, picked up my menus to look through for something to order & decided to leave a review.

When my friend wanted to meet up on the evening of Christmas Day, this bar was at least open at 11 pm.\n\nThis is your standard Pittsburgh dive bar and is comparable to Shenanigans down the road. My mixed drink was $2, which as a resident of D.C., left me shocked. The drink was mostly sours and small, but I almost wished to move back to somewhere so inexpensive. The kitchen was closed, but they do $4 pizza and appetizers later at night apparently. The kitchen closes early, though, most week nights. I might have been interested in trying the food another time, if not for other issues.\n\nAs other have mentioned, you will be thrown back to the 1920s and shave five years off of your life as you inhale second hand smoke. My friend and I went in a back room where there was no one smoking, but you cannot really escape the stench. The people drinking in here could be defined as Yinzer trash, as it was all white people making audible racist remarks, while throwing food at each other. The bartender was rude and did nothing to stop this, which was really not OK. I am more than ecstatic to be a city dweller, and had I not forgotten my ruby slippers, I would have clicked my heels to go home.

The bartender told me that was only Thursdays despite what I was looking at on the menu. I then asked to order the $4 appetizers on special from 9-10. The bartender again said no...it was now an 11-10 special despite what the menu said. I left without ordering and passed on my review via Facebook. I was shortly thereafter contacted by the owner who apologized for a miscommunication but said \"there is only a pizza special on Thursday, but we do have $4 specialty pizzas 9-10 every day.\" So yes...there was a pizza special that I was not allowed to order due to a miscommunication. After offering a gift card, I turned it down. They then asked me what it would take to take down my negative review. I basically said I was not one sided about my review. I pointed out the quality wings. I even chose not to review until my 3rd time here. I said I would change my review when service gets consistently quality to where I don't have to leave the establishment not able to order food.

Things like riding a subway, eating a meal by big windows overlooking downtown, taking in a show, kissing you significant other under the lights on a snowy night in the holiday season... The Garden Cafe just made that list. And the best part was it wasn't something I knew would fit the bill.\n\nThe Garden Cafe sits in the courtyard next to Heinz hall, on the corner of Liberty and 6th (where 6th doglegs to become Market in front of the Fairmont Hotel). The cafe is only open on days when the weather forecast is favorable because the entire place is outside. You walk into the plaza, and there is a table with a register. You order here, and go and find a table on the brick patio, sitting among fountains, trees, and the beauty of this serene downtown setting, separated from the randomness and dirt of the sidewalk by the beauty of brick walls with lush greens growing atop. \n\nI had a chicken and brie wrap with corn something (salsa?) and some kind of Aioli suase... it was AMAZING. And it was served with a quarter pickle spear and fires. The fries were shoestring, crispy, DELICIOUS and awesome. The Wrap didn't seem huge (big enough, I figured, for a light lunch), and the whole thing was $7.something with the initial included 10% gratuity. \n\nI was stunned when I returned to my office and found myself fighting off a food coma. SO filling. This place is unbelievable and has such an amazing ambiance. You feel like you are really in a city, but an idealistic one where everyone is nice, all the air smells amazing, the new buildings are cool and unique and the old ones are classy and ancient in their stories. You get the feeling that you can conquer the world and when you get back to the office you are going to win that big account. OK... i guess this has nothing to do with the food, but it is pretty cool. The fountains, the trees, the food, the staff... all just really great! \n\nIt was a little windy and that made it slightly challenging to eat normally, and the sounds from busses can on occasion be a little much. You will also hear any crazies yelling from the other side of the wall, but only the loudest ones. \n\nI would absolutely recommend this place. \n\nWeekdays 11:30-2:30, weather permitting.\n"}], "oxb73l504iA68bWdHqymHQ": [{"author": "Russell D.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2019-10-26", "description": "Typical Denny's which is good The food is exactly what you expect the people are friendly and service excellent Not much I can add\n"}, {"author": "Adam H.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2019-10-16", "description": "It's Denny's, what is there really to say?\n\nSo after having just moved to the area and not making it to the store yet, my.breakfast pickings on UberEats were slim.\n\nI opted for Denny's Build Your Own Slam due to the free delivery. \n\nThe pancakes were fluffy and had good flavor, the sausage & bacon were barely warm, and the hashbrowns were great.

Welp, the last three times, they have screwed up our orders--this last visit kinda was the reason I'm knocking stars off my rating. We usually always order the same hamburgers & wavy fries-because we think they are the best burgers coming from a chain restaurant. Last three times I requested to \"build my own\" burger--ground beef patty, very well done, Brioche bun, Swiss cheese, onions and lettuce with mustard. First time--they gave me American cheese--which I despise. They took it back (waitress was very kind!) and when she brought it back it had fried onions and mushy on it--NOPE--brought it back again and it was correct but ice cold fries. They did bring hot fries-and plenty of them to compensate for the burger debacle. Next visit--same request except I asked for NO CHEESE--came back with the stinkin American cheese again. They corrected it and it was fine. Third time's a charm--last night I ordered same thing--Swiss, Brioche bun, raw onions, lettuce and mustard. What did I get???? Swiss cheese, BACON, TOMATO, PICKLES and onions...my spouse's burger was also screwed up-ordered the Bourbon Bacon burger--received it with NO bacon and we both received crappy COLD bottom of the pan fries with all the little bits they could scrape up. TERRIBLE. Now please understand--we are not the nasty, complainers that some people are known to be-we are gracious, hate to complain and I actually gave my spouse the bacon that was inadvertently placed on my burger-just to avoid any conflict-but-that's the last time. It seems there was no manager there (6/6/2019) and it seemed rather chaotic-at one point even one of the waitresses yelled \"get the door\"!!!! And everyone looked wondering what was happening. Apparently no one was hosting at the moment so there was an unnecessary line at the door. Our waitress, an older lady, was not too pleasant, until tip time, of course. She seemed rattled and was rushing through taking our order-which probably partially accounts for the mixed up burgers. She seemed to cut us off, not really being attentive to our requests. We are older as well and if she can't do her job well, it may be time to hang up her apron. There is another young waitress who is AWESOME and checked us out at the register. She has waited on us many times before and goes the distance to make sure our drinks are refilled and everything is good. Last night-our little waitress didn't bring us refills until we asked another waitress to ask her to bring them. The trouble with getting burger orders wrong is--even though you want to take them back and make them right--it's another 20 minutes and if one person gets their food, the other has to wait and eat theirs 20 minutes later.

Sometimes we were checked on often, sometimes we were left waiting for a chance to place an order or to ask for a refill.

My friend and I split our meals that night: a burger, a side salad, party nachos, and a grilled steak skewer. The burger and skewer were actually pretty good - I would say my skewer was even great, featuring well cooked and seasoned steak, all served on a lovely stack of hot fresh vegetables and crispy potatoes. My friend called her burger \"fine\", so, an average burger it must have been. But as for the salad, I could only enjoy a single bite before turning it over to my friend; it was dripping in dressing. Most disappointing, however, were the nachos, as the chips tasted stale - so stale that their pile of meat and toppings could not make up for it. Something that stake has no place in any kitchen.\n\nDisappointments there may have been, but as I mentioned, the main courses were actually pretty good. I felt that Denny's delivered an a-ok experience overall. Plus, I also got a large, cheap meal out of the deal.

I've tried a Calzone, the Supreme Italian Hoagie (twice) and the Buffalo Chicken House Rolls.  The first time I was here I ordered the Hoagie while the people I was with got pizzas. Some other coworkers came in after us and got pizzas also. To my surprise, everyone who got pizza were called before me. I waited over 20 minutes for a sandwich!  I ended up walking downstairs and asking about my food and was told they misplaced my order. No apology or anything. They hurriedly threw together the sandwich and sent me on my way. I was not impressed to say the least however, the sandwich itself was pretty good.  I do feel like it was a bit pricey for what you got though.  On another occasion, I got the Calzone which also took a long time to be made. But at least it wasn't forgotten. This time I wasn't impressed with the food. There wasn't much filling in the Calzone and it was fairly bland. Certainly not worth what I paid. Next, I got the Hoagie again along with Buffalo Chicken House Rolls to share. Finally, food was prepared quickly and I was happy with my meal. 1 out of 3 times doesn't cut it for me. I have not been back because there are better options for Pizza and Hoagies in the area with better prices and deals.  If they had owned up to the early mistakes and perhaps showed a sign of good faith towards me, maybe I'd feel a bit differently but that first impression of losing/forgetting my order and then just blowing it off left an impact.

It tasted like it sat out to long after cooked. Their was also a hair in my salad that I subsequently had to fish out of my mouth. \n\nI asked for them to add jalape\u00f1os to my salad at my request. I was a little surprised that they charged $1 for them. I have no problem paying for my jalape\u00f1os but I can buy an entire jar of them for $1.27 at Aldi.

We were looking for a unique place for lunch - and this is it! \n\nWe live near Bob's Garage, in Fox Chapel, which is known for it's outrageous Christmas decorations; however, we don't go very much anymore because it's a smoking establishment with below average food. Thee Olde Place Inn is now going to be my go-to place for the holidays. It was beautifully (and tastfully) decorated with garland, Nutcrackers, and wreaths. The fireplace kept the smaller dining area near the bar very cozy. And the food! I had one of the best piece of haddock I've had in a while, plus some very tasty from-scratch mac and cheese. My hubby had a fantastic burger and a few beers. \n\nOn a side note, two other cool things I noticed: There was another, huge dining room behind us, as well as a totally enclosed smoking area in the back, which we never smelled at all. Also, the ceiling tiles are covered with these really neat little twinkle lights that change pattern and color every few minutes.\n\nOur bill was reasonable; and, the waitress was super friendly and nice.

I was trying to find a place to eat and decided to check out this place since it was close. By the name and location I made some assumptions about the restaurant. I thought it was going to be a pub type environment with pub type food. I was half right. It is a pub environment. The menu, however was not pub food. The entrees started at $20. So instead of burgers we had porkchops, steak salad, and chicken. \nWhen you walk in you walk right into the bar which takes up almost the whole bar side of the restaurant. You walk around the bar to the place to be seated in the dining area which has 6 tables. It is very dark because the ceiling tiles are painted black with Christmas lights poked through. There are cloth table clothes which should have been the giveaway that this was not pub food. \nWe ordered drinks. I am not a tea connoisseur but the tea was awful. It was from a bar tap or mixed out of a can in the back. It was not fresh brewed. My meal started off with the salad. It was covered in red onion. Big chunks and thin slices. There were 2 black olives, a tablespoon of shredded carrots, and a big portion of iceberg lettuce. I had asked for it not to have tomatoes. I asked for Bleu Cheese dressing. It was as thin as water. It had hardly any taste. One of the people with me got wedding soup that was very delicious. \nI ordered a dish I hadn't heard of before called Chicken Martini. It was chicken medallions breaded with Parmesan cheese that were cooked until golden on the stove and then baked in the oven. The chicken was a golden brown with a white cream type sauce over it. The chicken was tender but it tasted like you were eating a mouth full of cheese. I love cheese but this was too much. I used a lemon wedge from my tea to squeeze on the chicken to give it a brightness. \nI tried the pork chops and they were cooked perfectly. If you go I would highly recommend them. The steak on the steak salad was also nicely done and there was a lot of it. It also came with some very tasty garlic bread. \nWe were definitely the youngest diners in the restaurant by at least 10 years. It made me want to call the guy, Robert, who does the restaurant makeovers. He would take it from the dark place that it is and bring the decor into 2016. They would draw a younger crowd. You need younger diners for when the seniors aren't able to dine out anymore. They have a good menu and most of the food is good. Sometimes you sacrifice environment for food.

When I found out about a restaurant located on that stretch of asphalt that was heralded as a well-kept secret, I knew I had a quest to complete. \n\nLocated on a byway that would fool anyone into thinking they'd driven off to a distant rural area, Thee Olde Place Inn has a time-worn regality to it both inside and out. A coat-of-arms serves as its insignia. The door, framed by a wall of stone, looks like it came from a Scottish castle. The ceiling of the interiors are cleverly lit in a way that whimsically evokes a starry night. A grand old fireplace can be found somewhere in middle the house. My immediate impression was that TOPI is either a casual neighborhood pub that is good for a burger and a beer or a romantic supper spot fit for lobster and filet mignon by candlelight depending on what your mood or occasion is. \n\nA little girl and her large family were celebrating a first communion in the ornate dining room, so Kay and I indulged in an early dinner at the bar. Motown provided the jukebox soundtrack to our meal as the Kentucky Derby played out on the tube and a conversation regarding hockey and proper lawn care took place between two middle-aged regulars. \n\nMy experience was so glowing that I'll ignore the fact that the boneless chicken breast in my Mixed Grill entree was a touch underseasoned and that TOPI's desserts, as moderately appetizing as mine was, come from an outside vendor (our server told us that despite the chef's passion for baking, TOPI is not allowed to bake their own cakes and pies due to some local bureaucratic nonsense that requires the use of a convection oven). Regardless, the flap of poultry was so supple, chewing was almost irrelevant. Completing the dish were ideally executed pieces of grilled New York strip steak and center cut pork chop, the former done medium-rare, the latter done medium. Beyond succulent, both pieces of meat were fragile, charred perfectly, and yielded to knife, fork, and canine with no resistance, making them worthy of the finest steakhouses sans reservations and formal attire. Hidden slyly beneath the proteins were a juicy tomato slice and a heap of fried onion strings. \n\nAccompanying the main course was a golden helping of buttery smashed redskin potatoes that warmed my stomach and heart with starchy, comforting flavors. \n\nAn invigoratingly fresh salad dressed with a pungent, housemade Italian vinaigrette served as the palate-renewing prelude to the highlight of the meal: The Crab Au Gratin appetizer. \n\nServed in a crock with magnificently toasted pita triangles that were tasty enough to be eaten plain, the breadcrumb-topped dip itself contained a broiled orange-colored fondue loaded with jumbo lump crabmeat, smoked bacon, and beer cheese.  Hedonistic in flavor and texture, each chewy, mildly crispy wedge of bread served as but a vessel for the melted, smelted, gloriously gloppy spread. After running out of pita canapes, we used our dinner rolls to sop up the remainder of the au gratin, not wanting to waste one smudge of this amazingly tempting starter. \n\nOur server, whose name escapes me, was affable, attentive, and never kept us waiting long for anything, honoring any and all special requests without griping and talking us up as if we were recurring customers. \n\nThere's a beauty to the clandestine nature of certain institutions that reside in Pittsburgh's southern suburbs, so much so, that I almost feel as if I'm ruining them for everyone simply by reviewing them. Although, come to think of it, why hoard Thee Olde Place Inn's charm for but a few? That would be a crime. \n\nGet over to Baldwin sometime, and let Chefs Dom and Lulu take care of you.\n\nP.S. The Salted Caramel Cake was just fine for what it was and from where it originated. However, might I suggest that TOPI take on some stovetop desserts that don't require an oven like Cherries Jubilee, Bananas Foster, or Cinnamon Crepes? Or some chilled, no-bake items such as homemade ice cream, chocolate pudding, tiramisu or fruit mousse parfaits? All one needs is a fryer for funnel cake or doughnut holes. Creme Brulee only needs a spell under a broiler. A waffle iron can produce wonderful things as well for obvious reasons. Let's hope they consider their options or are able to cut through the legal red-tape eventually.\n"}, {"author": "Matt D.", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2014-07-17", "description": "I just got back from dinner with my family at the old place and I can't emphasize enough my disappointment.

So it is very safe for people who are not wanting the spice as it is not spicy. \n\nThe long islands were delicious and for the price of ten bucks a mug- I was really happy enjoying all I had to eat!\n"}, {"author": "Bethany F.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2019-06-10", "description": "Been here twice...it's great.

During lunch in the middle of the week makes it easy for a bigger group to come there but I imagine it gets more filled up as the night goes on. \n\nTheir food was great! I ordered the French onion soup, which is my absolute favorite soup to be had and it was just right. Not too salty or overdone and loads of cheese which made it even better. I also ordered a Cajun chicken salad. I ordered the fries on the side, however. There could've been more lettuce in the salad but it all tasted great. Lots of chicken and good spice. The fries were super crispy and delicious. The only two negatives I found weren't with me but my co-workers. One ordered a burger and she said it was not seasoned enough but everyone has different pallets when it comes to seasoning. And my other co-worker ordered steamed veggies as his side and it was A LOT of undercooked red onions, mushrooms and some zucchini.

Wild is too spicy for me these days. The sandwich comes with both mild and wild sauces. I also requested for Swiss cheese instead of pepper jack. And that the sandwich come with chips.

The hot sauce isn't very tasty. I don't know what it is. But it's salty & bland. No ketchup.  However the chicken sandwich with just cheese and peppers is very tasty.

I decided on the Clark Bar.  \n\nI've only been to the Clark Bar once before for lunch about three years ago. I remember being impressed with the Boomer Burger and even tweeted the following about it: \"Just had a Boomer Burger at the Clark Bar for #lunch. Half pound of deliciousness discovered on the N. Shore of #pgh\" (the accompanying pic that I took that day is uploaded here). So I came back to drink a few beers and have some dinner with my lady before the show. \n\nSpeaking of beers, there's a limited selection of craft beers here.  As of this writing, on tap they've got Penn Marzen, Dogfish Head 60 min and Sam Adams Cold Snap.  In bottles there's Bells Two Hearted IPA and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (they also listed Blue Moon and IC Light as craft beers but I'm sorry, I don't think so).\n\nI walked in the door at around 5:30 and I noticed that it wasn't too crowded; possibly due to the weather.  There were four guys at the bar and a couple of tables were occupied but nothing like I've experienced at the establishments on the other side of the parking lot.\n\nWhile waiting for my date to join me, I started with a Sam Adam's Cold Snap as a tribute to the day's February, single digit, temps before moving on to the Marzen. Both were decent beers, very drinkable, but nothing all that special.\n\nIt was pushing close to 7:00 when we decided to order dinner. By that time we were the only people left in the bar.  We asked the bartender about the crowd they get and if this is normal for a Friday night.  He said that lunchtime is normally their busiest time and he gets a few regulars that work in the building after 5:00 for a bite and a few drinks. Other than those times, it's before and after the ball games that draws the most business (as you would expect).\n\nThe menu is pretty simple offering a few appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches and the \"House Specialty\" Fish and Chips.  There were also specials listed on a chalk board at the entrance announcing drink specials, wings and a Cajun burger.  I decided I would go Cajun tonight. My girlfriend settled on a turkey burger. \n\nMy Cajun burger was spicy good delicious; perfectly grilled with a slice of pepper jack cheese and hot pepper rings balanced with a tomato slice and lettuce. I also got a sample slice of my lady's turkey burger (yeah, we do that) and it was juicy goodness as well topped with cheddar cheese, onion, lettuce and tomato. Her burger came with slaw and mine with fries.\n\nOverall this is a casual, easy bar.  They obviously recognize their Pittsburgh roots and being nestled between the two stadiums they cater to the Pittsburgh sports fan.  Photos of past local sports teams and legends adorn the walls in a relatively tasteful manner. But what's really cool is all of the autographed baseballs, bats and footballs in the hallway behind the bar.\n\nI'd recommend this place to any out-of-towner or anyone going to see a ball game or show on the North Shore. I give it a solid 4 stars for ambiance, service and delicious burgers. If the beer selection was better I would have up it to five stars.\n"}, {"author": "Nena U.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2016-08-08", "description": "Bacon Cheeseburger with blue cheese \"sauce\" is outstanding!!!!!

Offices and a cigar lounge also occupy the building. \n\nNote #2: The Clark Bar & Grill is open on Saturdays for stadium events and has extended hours for such occasions.\n\nFor something that is supposedly a 20 year-old Pittsburgh institution, it's a surprise that it has gone unYelped for so long. Even more suprising is the fact that it never even comes up in conversations.   \n\nAlice Cooper was in town to horrify rockers at Stage AE, and Kay needed some grub before the show, so here we came.\n\nCB&G is certainly looking over its shoulder due to its location. A sports fan will be impressed with all the memorabilia that decorates the walls. An autographed and framed Barry Bonds photo hung to the left of Kay's pretty little head. \n\nSandwiches and burgers dominate the simple American menu. A septet of salads, a daily soup, various appetizers, and a handful of entrees ranging from Southern fried chicken and gnocchi to broiled salmon round out their roster.\n\nOh, you know I got a burger, despite almost getting the fried chicken. Clark Bar & Grill offers 8 different kinds, but I went for the Boomer Burger, which they allege to be their \"classic\" burger. \n\nLettuce, tomato, onion, and mayonnaise (my standard build) fixed up this sturdy juicer of a patty with an even sturdier bun holding it all. \n\nIt  had the most elegant and beautiful melt I've ever seen or eaten on a burger. Whoever grilled this must have use the cover-and-steam method like a Zen master for the golden American cheese caparisoned the luscious beef croquette like an evening gown would a baroness. CB&G has other more adventurous burgers on their menu, but who needs bleu cheese, black raspberry BBQ sauce, garlic, or Thousand Island Dressing when this kind of brilliant economy is just as satisfying? \n\nAlso exquisite was the toasty pile of unpeeled french fries; hot oil-plunged perfection. \n\nIf you went into a 5 star restaurant, were allowed to order whatever your palate desired, and chose a diner burger/fries combo, this is what you'd get.\n\nKay will likely do her own review, but Kay's Broiled Fish (cod with either Cajun or lemon pepper seasoning)  didn't seem to excite her a heckuva lot. The common brownie a la mode was CB&G's sole dessert that day. Upon asking our proficient and kindly waitress Jill about the brownie's origins, she sheepishly admitted that it was frozen and then reheated. Hurm.  \n\nI have a feeling Kay's gonna give them a 3, but based on what I ordered, CB&G deserves a solid 4 stars. Skip the Tilted Kilt and try The Clark Bar & Grill for something sane, affordable, and respectable if a pre-event meal on the North Shore is what you need. \n\nP.S. I am a little befuddled that the restaurant doesn't offer a dessert involving Clark Bars. Can they be deep fried? They can at least be incorporated into homemade vanilla ice cream, no?\n\nP.P.S.

I was a little skeptical when this place opened up near me..I'm thinking in my head like \"New York Super Subs,\" what the heck is that gonna be, just huge subs that are so-so in quality.  I started going here a couple months ago (a few months or so after they had opened up), and this place is subtly phenomenal.\n\nThere are two workers there whom I remember from having seen them multiple times as I go in, and they are awesome - a lady and a guy, I think maybe both wear glasses, not sure. The guy seems like he might be the owner?  I wish I had gotten their names here so I could give them credit.  I go to a lot of restaurants (you can tell by the check-ins I have at various places here on yelp), but this place has had just wonderful customer service.  I'm pretty indecisive sometimes, and I love that they don't rush me.  And I also love that they give me suggestions when I ask for them.  I typically am annoyed if I ask someone at a restaurant or food joint for a suggestion on their menu and they say something generic like, \"Everything is good\" or \"Whatever you're feeling you should get\" - well, the reason I'm asking is because I don't know what I'm feeling or wanting.  But I wanted to say it's not the case here, their suggestions have been good and thoughtful, which I appreciate, especially when I'm in between what bread I want (croissant vs roll), or what kind of sandwich I want (sub vs some deli sandwich like fish or tuna).  I can tell, too, because they tell me WHY they choose it.  I remember one time I asked if most people get the fish sandwich with cheese, and they said sometimes they do, but the worker said they like it without the cheese as it enhances and brings out the fish flavor of the fish sandwich.  Although I ended up going with cheese (because I am too in love with cheese to say no), I appreciated that a thoughtful response was given.  And they sometimes tell me croissants are good because they're buttery and flaky, and they're right, they are good for the sandwiches I get.\n\nI don't write reviews super frequently because they take time, especially because I tend to write a lot, but I have to give credit where credit is due.  I just love this place, I like going in, it's clean and bright.  And the people are nice.  And then there's the food. It is really, really good.  And then there's the one day my life changed - I got the fish sandwich (which is offered only seasonally for Lent :( ) but it was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  Literally the BEST fish sandwich I ever ate in my life, and one of the best sandwiches (fish or otherwise) that I have ever eaten in my life.  There's food that haunts you, that you think back on months, or even years, later and think to yourself with a chill about how amazing the flavor was, every last bite.  I got a fish sandwich with provolone cheese on it and it was perfection, and I still think about it a month or two later.  That's how much I loved it (and probably will think about it for years more to come).  And it was soooo cheap and filling compared to eating out at sit-down restaurants.  And 10-20 times more satisfying and full of flavor!  I just wish that it was available all year round, because I would eat it all year round.  Seriously, it's one of those sandwiches that are so good that I don't even need to compare it to anything else, because I am THAT satisfied with this one, because I am that confident that this one is the best. That's how insanely good it was and is.\n\nAnyways, the bottom line is this place is amazing in more ways than one, and you should check it out if you haven't already.\n"}, {"author": "Laura G.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-04-06", "description": "Fast and pleasant service.

We had both driven by Valiants many times in the past and for some reason had never gone so I was happy to oblige him whenever he expressed an interest.  Whenever we got there the parking lot was mostly full, both front and back and I think we got the last spot.  We then walked around the restaurant and went in and seated ourselves in a booth.  The inside of Valiants looks like how you would picture an old diner complete with lunch counter, checkboard floors, 50's/60's pictures on the wall (Elvis, Betty boop, Marilyn Monroe and other diners) and interesting colored mint green booths.\n\nFor lunch on this day I decided to go with the Valiant burger with a side of fries.  According to the menu, the burger was an 8 oz party with Swiss cheese, grilled peppers, onions and mushrooms.  It ended up taking a pedestrian 30 minutes from ordering until it got to our table which I normally wouldn't mention but with a somewhat fussy 1 year old at our table, it felt longer.  Honestly I wasn't expecting much from it due to its price ( less than $6) and the 2.5 star Yelp rating for Valiants.  So I was pleasantly surprised whenever I bit into the burger and I thought it was actually quite good.  It was larger than I expected as well with ample toppings and a nice layer of Swiss on the top.  The only part that could have used improvement was the bun.  While it was toasted it could have been toasted longer as the bun ended up being soggy and fell apart whenever I ate it.  Their fries were crinkle cut and came out piping hot and tasted pretty good.  When eaten plain they could have used some more salt but whenever I added Franks red hot to them I was happy.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.

This version was thick with gloppy mayo (and not the usual horseradish tangy sauce) and had possibly 2 wilted leaves of arugula and zero of the pickled red onions.  And, then, to top things off, the area where customers are supposed to clear their plates was kinda gross.  The trash bin open and overflowing.  Tables weren't wiped down and the bathroom?

She waited on other tables and ignored us. 20 minutes later when she came back she handed us a new check. Or what we thought was a corrected check. \n\nWhen we got to the register, it was the exactly same check (after she told us she would adjust it). At the register we asked to speak to the manager and we waited for another 20 minutes but no manager appeared. We had spent enough time waiting at the Pancake House.  We were tired of waiting and ended up paying and leaving. At that point, we just wanted to go home. Customer service seems like a very low priority. We were really disappointed with this experience.\n"}, {"author": "Joe G.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2018-10-13", "description": "Not bad, but nothing special. The omelets had a weird aftertaste.

There was no thought concept idea awareness prior past experience knowledge of what happens when entering a restaurant be it IHOP or Au Pied de Chochon. There needs to be a host station where someone can greet guests. It needs to be somewhere visible. There needs to be a place where people can gather while this is going happening. Not outside of the restaurant in the vestibule immediately at the bottom of the stairs shared w the restaurant on the second floor. And no one working inside can see that there are four, six, eight people sheepishly waiting there at the unstaffed podium unless they walk out there to check. Huh. I have been in many busy successful places where the host station is crammed and jammed and annoying. I have been in many where you wonder if someone really works there.

We decided to order the more enticing apps of the full menu then the hh menu.\n\nThe cocktails we had that were seasonal, were very tasty, whereas the HH cocktails tasted mostly of champagne (not a problem, but in comparison we were let down).\n\nFor our appetizers we got meatballs, fried artichoke hearts, and the Brussels sprouts.   The winner of the three was definitely the sprouts.  I have never had such tasty sprouts before.  Crispy with a touch of sweetness from honey - delish, we finished the huge plate and thought about ordering more.

Battered and deep fried with marinara sauce on the side - I would expect to see this more in a bar/pub setting and was a bit let down.\n\nThe four of us shared the following entrees: Chicken Parmesan, Eggplant Parmesan, the Gnocci, and the Bolognese.  The hands down winner (and the reason I gave it 4 stars over 3) was the gnocci.  It tasted of delicious roasted red pepper, and was (i think) lightly deep fried.  This gave the gnocci a slighlty crunchy texture on the outside, followed by the smooth, velvet cloud that you get from a stellar gnocci.  I would return for this dish.  The chicken parm and bolognese were good, but didn't stand out in the same way.  Standard, good, but not amazing.

The risotto did not disappoint, and was big enough that I took a third home with me for the next day's lunch.\n\nFor dessert we had limoncello gelato (me) and cannoli (the others).  My gelato was perfect, but the cannoli was a little disappointing to the others at my table.\n\nI would give this three and one-half stars based on the service. Our server seemed to have an attitude that was off-putting, strolling over to our table with his hands in his pocket, cutting me off when I was asking a question, etc. I'm usually pretty forgiving in this regard, but his attitude detracted from the experience.\n"}, {"author": "Debbie T.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-11-29", "description": "Simply the best!

Everything we had was delicious. The restaurant week value was good, though I didn't notice the regular menu prices to comment on value of the normal options. I thought the drinks were slightly expensive, although everything was good. We thoroughly enjoyed everything we had to eat and drink. \n\nOur server was very personable and was happy to make recommendations if asked. The decor was a nice cross of rustic and industrial. My only complaint was noise volume. During prime dinner hour on a Friday, it was extremely loud. There was also a large party next to us, which may have contributed to the noise, as well. \n\nOverall, we loved the food and atmosphere and will definitely be back outside of Restaurant Week.\n"}, {"author": "Lauren B.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2019-08-03", "description": "It's nice to see another Italian restaurant in the area.  The atmosphere is cozy, spacious and well lit. I went there for dinner and we shared the caprese salad and meatballs as appetizers which were on the happy hour specials. For dinner we both had one of the specials of the day which was a Puttanesca pasta.  All of the food was excellent and all ingredients were very fresh and of high quality.  The heirloom tomatoes on the burrata caprese salad were beautifully colored and so flavorful and the meatballs were delicious, just like my Italian grandmother used to make.  The puttanesca pasta was very flavorful and the noodles tasted homemade.  My only issue with the pasta was at one point I bit into a large red pepper which left my mouth burning for a few minutes.  Normally I like spicy food, but it was a bit unexpected since this was not a spicy dish, so watch out for those if you don't like spice! They also served the meal with warm bread and a skillet of warm olive oil with roasted garlic cloves, which was a nice touch (and fresh bread should be a requirement at any Italian restaurant!). One surprising thing that was lacking was fresh shaved parmesan cheese, which I would have expected at an Italian fine dining establishment.  When we asked for Parmesan with our pasta, they brought out a shaker of parmesan cheese like you see at a casual pizza joint. The other reason I docked a star was the service was a bit lacking. Although the servers were attentive they weren't very friendly and didn't go out of their way. For example, I had a question about an ingredient in one of the cocktails. She said she didn't know the answer and just stood there waiting for me to decide rather than asking the bartender who was nearby. I asked her to come back in a few minutes so I could find the answer myself.  Then later when I ordered a glass of wine they brought the wrong wine.  I didn't say anything since it wasn't a big deal, but these details make a difference.  But overall it was a good experience and I would go there again. The portions are generous and of high quality and it is a good value for the price.\n"}, {"author": "Jessi S.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-11-23", "description": "We had great food and great service at Garbarinos tonight.

It's twist on the concept is home style food, which it delivers. The dining room is attractive and, amazingly, there is convenient parking near by. The menu is short, with a few salads, pasta dishes, and several entree choices. We had an excellent caprese salad, and eggplant parmigiana and pasta in vodka sauce with meatballs. We liked the food, which met expectations, but except for the salad, nothing was outstanding. The wine situation is a little confusing. The website list is the same as the Twisted Frenchman's, all French and $$$$. I therefore planned to bring my own until I called and found out that there is a $$ Italian wine list. The wine choices were pretty good. Service from the bartender was excellent because the restaurant was not very busy (not a good sign!). Prices are quite reasonable and the cocktails were very good.

Chef Drew is absolutely able to deliver delicious Italian meals with all the skill and creativity I've known him for in this change in concept. His family's experience with running an Italian restaurant in NJ definitely shows!\n\nSo, the space has changed very little - it's still trendy with an incredible bar and wine cellar. The kitchen is still well outfitted, and now sports a pasta extruder, which produces the most delicious fresh pasta I've had anywhere - more on that later. The noise level is probably the only negative for me - I had issues with it when we came to this space, and was happy to learn from the Chef that they have plans for acoustic tiles and baffles to help decrease ambient noise so diners can enjoy their conversations more. The music was good, and not overly loud - it was a nice background for the meal without getting in the way.\n\nWe were warmly greeted upon arrival, and seated immediately. Our server, an extremely friendly young lady who also dances for the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, was very attentive to all of our requests during the evening and made sure we were able to enjoy ourselves. Overall, the pace was a little slower than I'd prefer, but I learned that it was a result of a temporary staff shortage and the recent and significant increase in popularity of the restaurant, which is just about the best reason for things to run a little slow. They are aware of this, and also are working to make this better. All of the staff were working very hard, and were skilled in their actions.\n\nNow, for the menu - it's a little long for my taste, but since I'm not running a restaurant, I won't be overly critical. We had a big party with diverse tastes and dietary restrictions and the expansive menu gave us great options. The cavatelli with rapini and Italian sausage was delicious, as was my fusilli with shrimp, mussels, and scallops. The scallops were enormous and perfectly cooked (as was the rest of the dish). I cannot praise the quality and taste of the pasta enough - in most places, the flavor of pasta barely registers. Here, it has a certain freshness which can only come from being made with excellent ingredients that don't sit around for long periods of time. The tomato sauce that accompanied my dish was super bright and not the heavy acidic sauce that plagues most Italian eateries. They even had high quality garlic that had been sliced with a mandoline dispersed throughout the plate - a nice inclusion. The only thing that would have made my dish even more delicious would have been to have freshly ground pepper and freshly grated Parmeggiano Reggiano offered / applied to the plates at the table side by the serving staff. This should be a simple addition to make for service if they agree with my statement. I didn't feel that the dishes were lacking, just that the experience could have been heightened by this small addition.\n\nChef Drew continues to make the rounds and enjoys meeting his diners, always sharing insights and listening to them. It's a wonderful personal touch, that is definitely noticed. It would be easy to hide out in the kitchens upstairs and downstairs, but he adds this practice to his skill set as a dedicated professional, and seems to have a genuine interest in those who frequent his establishments.\n\nBravo! We definitely look forward to our next visit, and know that this wonderful restaurant will be well worth the trip across the river, even when we have another two Italian places close by - this place beats them hands down. Thank you, and we wish the crew at Garbarino's (and of course the Twisted Frenchman) every success as they continue with their passion.\n"}, {"author": "Carolyn F.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2019-08-14", "description": "After coming to Garbarinos for restaurant week, we had a lovely experience.

Bottom line, a very good and relaxing meal that could use a few tweaks but I think has a very promising future.\n\nThe hostess had our reservation and got us right to a very nice booth. Started with cocktails, and both my wife's Aperol spritz and my Woodford Reserve Rye old fashioned were spot-on. We decided to start with a share of the grilled asparagus and the fried calamari. For main courses, I ordered the grilled veal chop (not the parmesan version--a little confusing in the menu), and my wife ordered the eggplant parmesan with a side of rigatoni marinara (off menu, but more to follow on that).\n\nGoods/Greats:\n- Again, cocktails were outstanding, as was the glass of Barbera I had at our server's recommendation with my veal dish.\n- The calamari was excellent. Cooked perfectly with a feather-light breading. All rings to the delight of my wife (I love the tentacles, but I know I'm in the minority). Both the marinara and chili aioli sauces were really good, and it was fun to alternate between the two.\n- Grilled asparagus was easily the best I've ever had. Perfect cook, amazing grilled flavor. Roasted red peppers were delicious. We had some with our appetizers, kept them on the table with our entrees, and even brought some home for leftovers. Fantastic each and every time.\n- Veal chop entree of all things was a vegetable party. Perfectly grilled green beans as well as very good, lightly dressed arugula. Veal chop itself was a big, fresh, and very good piece of meat.\n- Eggplant parmesan was very tasty (and oddly, even better the next day as leftovers), but the simple pasta side of rigatoni marinara was absolutely delicious. The house marinara is so perfect I wish I could buy jars of it.\n- Service was overall very good.\n- Leftover packaging was fantastic. They even take the time to label what's in every container. Never seen this before and we loved it!\n\nOthers:\n- Bread came out with small skillet of roasted garlic in pool of melted butter.  I thought it was heavenly--I could drink melted butter with a straw and eat roasted garlic with a spoon, but it was a major turn-off to my wife. The option of some normal butter and/or some herbed olive oil and vinegar would be nice, as I'm sure lots of people don't like dripping butter.\n- When asked to describe the eggplant parmesan dish, the best our server could do is \"well, it's just eggplant parmesan.\" I'd argue it a little different than most restaurants as it's just an individual casserole. Don't get me wrong--it was very good--but I'm glad we could get a side of pasta at a small upcharge. Their chicken parmesan comes with pasta, so why not the eggplant?\n- I overall enjoyed the veal chop dish, but frankly it was just too busy and could really stand some editing. Besides the previously mentioned veggies, it had a heap of crab meat with olives and pesto hollandaise on top. Every individual component was delicious, but it was just too much stuff. I was looking forward to a perfectly grilled veal chop with some great accompaniments, but ultimately the chop got a little overwhelmed by the toppings. Sear on the veal could have been just a bit better, too.\n\nIn summary, lovely space, delicious food and great add to the neighborhood, and we're definitely looking forward to coming back. A tiny bit of refinement and it's well on its way to being a five-star destination.\n"}, {"author": "Laurie H.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-10-23", "description": "What a gem!

It is thicker than places like Fioris or IVP, but the dough is fresh and cooked perfectly.  All of the ingredients they use seem to be high-quality and it makes for a great pizza.\n\nGreat place to come for lunch or dinner.  Also, their Tuesday buffet is a great bargain.  Make sure to show up early though because it gets packed.\n"}, {"author": "Ashley W.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2017-12-16", "description": "My husband & I are Bados regulars. The very first time we ate there, we had a terrible experience.  We decided to give it another chance whenever we moved right up the road, and I'm glad we did. We get takeout at least twice a month, and sometimes eat in too. They have a nice breakfast menu. Recently, they had a special that was egg nog French toast, and it was really good.\nTypically, we get lunch or dinner. I absolutely love their vodka sauce. I usually get the pene vodka add Italian sausage and it never disappoints. One thing they could work on is getting some real garlic bread. They use hoagie buns to make \"garlic toast\" and it's not very good and always over toasted.  Not sure why they don't use regular Italian bread. The hot Italian hoagie is pretty good, and my husband loves their pizza. Their house Italian dressing is delicious and the anti pasta salad is a great deal. I always get two meals out of it. Bados service is decent and they have a nice deck upstairs for out door eating whenever the weather is nice.

I found it to be adequate.  The price, at $6.95, is fair for what you get, but unlike some of my other favorite lunchtime pizza buffets, this one does not include the drink, so that is extra.  It does come with a soup or salad included in the price, and I chose the Wedding Soup, and unfortunately, I was not enamored by the soup at all.  It didn't have much taste, and even after adding salt, pepper, and grated cheese, it still wasn't very flavorful.  As for the pizzas, they had three choices, Pepperoni, Plain, and Supreme.  I thought the pizzas were just O.K.  I am not a big fan of pepperoni, so I personally found the choices a little limited, since two out of three had pepperoni on them.  I did try a slice of each, and they were fine, but the taste to me was just average.  I was hoping that they might bring out a different style of pizza once the first pies cleared off, but they only brought out another pepperoni while I was there.   Overall, it was a decent lunch buffet, but in my opinion, there are better ones in the area.\n"}, {"author": "Casey K.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2016-11-01", "description": "We recently hosted an event at Bado's for our family. \n\nI was able to easily speak with the event coordinator and set up the details of our event when I called. I customized the menu a bit due to some food allergies and called in two weeks ahead of time to confirm our count for our \"adult pizza party\" off of the banquet menu.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were able to set up early and get ready for the event. Everyone was able to fit comfortably in the space and since the private room is upstairs, you also have access to the outdoor deck area. The room was clean and well laid out. There were also 2 TVs, a private bar, and the outdoor deck.\n\nFor food we had a mix of veggies and various dips, sandwich ring, and pizza. The pizza was probably the biggest party pizza I'd ever seen and was a big hit with guests. Included in the pizza party per person pricing were also three beers that were on tap.\n\nThe one weird thing was that at the end of the party there was some leftover food (i.e. about a quarter of a pizza); so as I was paying the bill I of course asked for it to be boxed up. Before this there was no indication that it was \"catering\" style and that any leftover food was to be left in the restaurant. I was told that the food could not be boxed due to house rules. I didn't understand since I had literally just paid for all of the food, but wasn't able to take it with me. It also wasn't explained well when I asked about it. In general it made me feel like they were being super sticklers and honestly ruined my excitement about telling others about the good parts of our experience.\n\nFor what the party was, it was a great room to host an event, but there are definitely some oddities that need worked out.\n"}, {"author": "Jamie K.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2017-12-28", "description": "I went to Bado's with some friends on a Sunday for brunch.

Well the 'Famous' in my food title must stand for famously bad. It was the worst piece of fish I have ever had...it was flat as a pancake...no flaky white fish to be seen.  I'd equate it to eating a sponge full of grease. The only taste out of it was from whatever other food shared the grease bath. Maybe I could have disguised the taste with the condiments I asked for but the disinterested fellow I mentioned before didn't bring them until asked and the sandwich was half done. As for my wife's burger...the taste was good but it was way over cooked since she ordered medium and the burger was well done.

The buffet was small but had pizza to suit anyone's food personality!

The kids at he tables surrounding us were all giggly and happy when the man was delivering their balloon gifts!\n\nAlso, it is worth noting that the bar area is separated from the restaurant section almost completely with a wall; so no need to worry that you and your family will not be able to enjoy each other's company or feel uncomfortable with little ones in the bar.

I ordered a ham and cheese omelet with broccoli added in. It was loaded with fresh ham and broccoli and more than enough cheese.

I wanted to hit both this truck and the PGH Pie Guy, but at the time that I arrived (5:45pm), the pie guy was packing up.  Because this was the only other truck at the event I was interested in trying, I ordered a chicken ranch spinach crepe and a strawberry nutella crepe so that I could try both a savory and a sweet variety.\n\nBased on the other reviews for this food truck, I was expecting the flavor of these crepes to be great.  Unfortunately, however, this was not the case.  The chicken ranch crepe was bland tasting, even despite the ranch sauce.  The strawberry crepe had a better flavor profile, but it still wasn't super-exciting.  It consisted only of chopped strawberries and nutella, with none of the powdered sugar or whipped cream mentioned in other reviews, so I can't help but wonder if I was shortchanged.\n\nOne other issue was the lack of napkins and utensils.  Given the messiness of both types of crepes, I expected these to be available, but I wasn't able to find any.  While I am not averse to eating the crepes by hand, doing so made for messy eating, and I wasn't able to clean up afterwards due to the lack of napkins.  While I'm not a huge napkin user, I was left with a messy mouth and hands after eating the crepes that I had no way of cleaning up, which further detracted from my experience.\n\nWhile I hate to leave a negative rating, I feel that I have to in this case, given the various shortcomings and lack of redeeming factors.  If napkins and/or utensils had been provided, I'd probably be willing to award 3 stars, but at present, I'm awarding 2.5 stars.  If you like or want to try crepes, there's a place on Craig St. in N.

A quick Google search showed a beautiful Cobb salad on the menu, and for a good bit less money than my current local favorite Shady Grove (and minus the bar scene noise and hassle), so off I went. \n\nThe place was deserted. One waitress, and at most two tables in use. So far, so good. It also appeared to be spotlessly clean- another big plus, obviously- although the Pergo/vinyl floor and dim, bluish lighting made it feel quite cold and not very welcoming. \n\nThe waitress tries to stick me at a table just in front of and across the aisle from the serving station, which had what looked like a pail of bleach sitting right in view, so I said I didn't want to sit right by the station. She tries to seat me a couple of tables away - equally close to the station but on the other side of it, cleaning pail still fully in view. I end up at a table in the far side of the restaurant at the very back, which was OK, although a bit of a hike. \n\nI order my salad, and the first clue that all would not be well surfaced when I learned that they don't have vinegar and oil, and that avocado is a whopping $0.90 extra. Well, OK, it's not a Cobb salad without avocado, and I love the stuff unreasonably, so fine. \n\nFood and decaf ordered, I head to the rest room. \n\nO. M. G., what a mess! Four stalls, and not a single one usable, *including* the handicapped one, which I need because of, well, walking issues, plus a large service dog. (Did I mention she stuck me at the very back of the restaurant, as far from the restroom as possible? Despite using a cane and said large dog?)\n\nExiting to get someone to clean the place up, I am greeted by the sight of a group of something like 20 people just arrived.  \n\nIt took forever, and at least 3 requests, including an actual threat to pee right there on the floor in the entry to get someone to clean it up at all. It had to be a good 15-20 minutes total before the server finally took a super quick swipe at it and I was able to use it. Standing only, though. \n\nOutside the restroom, the party of 20 church group has been seated, and both waitrons were buzzing busily around them. And the other two patrons who had also come in after I did. \n\nI get back to my table, expecting to be able to sit down and at the minimum start my coffee - and even the water isn't there yet. \n\nThe water and coffee show up, finally, and then my onion rings. The coffee and onion rings are both only lukewarm. The onion rings were at least warm enough to still be crisp, and were very tasty, but it was still disappointing. \n\nThe salad shows up. Oy gevalt, such a sorry looking thing! Limp greens, a mere sliver of avocado, the whole thing only barely covering the bottom of the bowl - nothing at all like the robust picture on the menu. At least it wasn't iceberg, but there was less than a cupful of greens. \n\nThey were out of blue cheese \"crumbles\", and I was offered parmesan cheese (or croutons) instead. I declined. Blech. \n\nThe bacon was limp and almost stone cold, only warm enough to let me know it had just been cooked, but was at least edible - which is a lot more than I can say for the chicken. Vile, disgusting- and clearly made of rubber. My dog went nuts for the smell of it, of course - but it was so gross I didn't even want to give it to him. \n\nSo now the \"Cobb\" salad that actually wasn't has lost absolutely *all* resemblance to what a Cobb salad actually should be. There wasn't even an egg. Way, way overpriced for what it was. \n\nI think the salad dressing was actually rancid. It was certainly the worst \"ranch\" dressing I've ever had, so I ate the salad (such as it was) completely bone dry. The party of 20+ was in full swing; there was clearly no way I was ever going to be able to get anything else this side of next weekend. The one ten days from now. \n\nNot that I was able to find even that out in a timely fashion, because the fork they gave me was filthy. So was the second one I was finally able to obtain after asking three different times. I did finally get a clean one.  \n\nNeedless to say, no one ever checked in to ask me how things were after serving me. \n\nI asked to have the charge for the avocado deleted when I went to pay, and at least the waitress was willing to do that. \n\nThis all went down several hours ago now, and my stomach is still churning in revolt. I'm hoping this will be the end of it.\n"}, {"author": "Kaysi S.", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2018-04-23", "description": "I went there with my friend to get food around midnight.

But unfortunately last Saturday night, my lofty expectations fell well short of what we had experienced here before. We arrived early for our reservation at this funky spot up the hill on the South Side, and decided to have a drink at the cool bar of what used to be the Workingman's Beneficial Union No. 6 lodge (somehow they get UUBU6 out of all of that). I was excited to see a large beer tub full of one of my favorite beers, Blue Point Hoptical Illusion, and quickly ordered two for the guys. Our ladies each decided on a pomegranate martini which were so strong even I had a hard time taking a sip. The four of us were seated in the grand main dining room with the yellow and green checker board ceiling and the dramatic yellow drapery. But unfortunately after we sat down, the staff forgot we were there. We waited almost 20 minutes until a server approached us and asked if we were ready to order. I said \"we would be happy to order if we had menus.\" You can see where this night was headed. The server apologized and quickly returned with our menus.  UUBU6's menu tonight looked nothing like the menu on the website (it does say \"menu subject to change upon the Whim of the Chef\" ) but I have to say we were very disappointed with the night's offerings. The entire first page was a Lenton menu ( this was a Saturday night) with 8-10 seafood specials. But the biggest disappointment was the fact that there was only one appetizer (asparagus frito misto) to go along with 3 or 4 salads. Are you serious???   The app selction on the website had so many different choices and our only option was asparagus which also happened to be the vegetable of the day?  Fortunately I saw a very attractive cheese and fruit plate on the dessert cart next to our table and we decided to order it for our appetizer. The waiter obliged and it was actually a very good selection of a Maytag blue, a brie, a borsin and a smoked Gouda to go along with the grapes, strawberries, crackers and bread. The wine list is extensive and is attached to every menu, so after finally settling on a bottle of wine, we were sorry to learn that it was unavailable. Our server suggested a similar California Red from the $20 bottle list. I was confused because none of our menus had this value list. So he returned with another menu and we were lucky to have a very good Cali Pinot Noir.  The salads were just okay with a blood-orange vinaigrette.  Nothing to get excited about.   But  my seafood bisque was very flavorful and hearty. My lady ordered the Hangar steak with mustard sauce and sweet potato fries. Our server informed us that he thought they were out of it so he asked her for a plan B in case it was unavailable. After another 20 minutes, we motioned to our server to see if she was getting the hangar steak and he informed us that there indeed was one left. We wished there hadn't been because the steak came out a little overcooked, but drowning in mustard flavor. But her biggest disappointment was that the accompanying fries weren't sweet potato, just plain ordinary steak fries. She wouldn't have ordered the steak if she had known they were out of sweet potatoes and our server again neglected to mention this to us. As for my dish, I went in ready to order either a duck or a lamb dish from the website but of course neither were on tonights menu.  So I decided on the soft shell crabs with spring onion and tomato relish. I chose poorly.  The \"salsa\" on top was just that, chopped tomato and sliced green onion.   But that was the least of my entree's problem. The soft shells were so salty I could feel my blood pressure rising with each bite. It was almost laughable but by now I was too hungry to send them back. Apparently it was contagious, because the accompanying asparagus also seemed to be inflicted with this same salt problem. In fairness, our dining companions enjoyed their dishes, I especially liked his Angus beef tenderloin (we like to try each others dishes) but his wife's salmon dish was a little on the dry side. The dessert cart (again, none of the desserts on the website were on the cart tonight) sells itself with the elegantly arranged trays of small cakes and pastries. The ladies' Chocolate flourless cake wasn't very awe-inspiring but a strawberry Napoleon with whipped cream was sublime. All things considered, and because of my $50 gift certificate (thanks WPXI Just Pay Half) our final tally came to $65 per couple.  All things considered, UUBU6 can give you a pretty good bang for your buck with the $20 wine list and also a $30 recession buster prix fix feature.   So as you can see, you can get pretty good value here.   As long as the kitchen and waitstaff  rekindle the commitment to excellence that I had come to expect when UUBU6 first ascended up the slopes of the South Side.\n"}, {"author": "A.

I was looking for somewhere to spend a little time between town and the airport and spent about an hour there right before closing on a Sunday.  It was oh so very quiet there, not like the more urban coffee shops with competitive seating.  There was an entire 3-seater couch and 2 easy chairs up for grabs.  There were a couple other people in the shop.\n\nThe barista was really friendly and interacted with super-shy me, which takes some doing.  I had read the menu in advance and had my heart set on one of their signature drinks, The Parking Chair.  I read the menu again anyway, and decided to order it, even after finding out that it is pre-mixed and thus cannot be made decaf.  They promised it would taste like melted espresso ice cream, and live up to that it did!  I don't 100% know what they put in it, but they say they use real ingredients, and it tasted that way.  This is not something to get on a regular basis as it was quite sweet, but it was a nice treat.\n\nI liked the open and airy space, the minimalist/industrial vibe, the peace and quiet.  I liked that I had somewhere cozy to relax.  I took over an easy chair and noticed they had a couple of issues of a magazine for coffee and tea professionals called The Cup.  I didn't get anything done I'd planned to do because I read this magazine cover to cover--it was a great & inspiring read.  I'm looking forward to trying more of their signature drinks, either in Ben Avon (where is Ben Avon anyway?) or in Coraopolis, probably on the way to or from the airport.\n\nPS: Coraopolis has a bit of a downtown so it's a good place to take a walk, too, if you make this coffee shop a destination.\n"}, {"author": "Keith T.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2018-08-23", "description": "Well I have seen this place when they were turning that shop into another great venue in Coraopolis .

We sat down and didn't have any service for about ten to fifteen minutes. When the person came over he asked for our orders and rolled his eyes when we asked to see a menu. All of this not a big deal because it is a bar. The reason why I write this review is because we watched our food sit at the bar for about fifteen to twenty minutes while everybody ignored it. There was literally no one there...... The girl then noticed it and we proceeded to watch her go through the trash with the other guy. She then proceeds to bring my partner's food, which is now disgusting and cold and tells me they made my food wrong.

During my last trip here in the past week, the tables were not wiped off, crumbs were on the seats everywhere, and the garbage cans in the seating area were missing.  I asked where the garbage cans were, and an employee informed me that they were expected to get our trays.  Boston Market, you cannot expect to treat people like waiters/waitresses while the public does not tip.  You are an awesome fast food place but do not try to be an Eat N' Park.  You are failing.  I insisted that I wanted to throw out my garbage (so my baby would stop trying to play in his food) & was instructed to leave it on the counter where people receive fresh food.  How gross.  Since the public is not tipping, do not treat your employees like waiters/waitresses.  They are not slaves.  They employees feel belittled.  Less cleaning is done.  Trash sits on tables and crumbs are not picked up.  There is no incentive for your employees to care about your establishment if you don't care about them.  Your dining experience declines.  This place was cleaner when employees were just expected to wipe off the tables & benches & customers handled their own garbage.  Please bring back the garbage cans & go back to being an awesome fast food place!  I believe Panera tried this before and FAILED.

Given that this place is a block from my apt., and that it was Ash Wed., I figured I'd stop by to pick up a fried fish sandwich.\n\nUpon walking up to the counter, I was confused by a sign saying \"no credit\" on the register next to a bunch of credit card decals and what appeared to be a credit card machine, so I began to ask the guy at the counter if they accept credit cards.  The phone started ringing, and he picked it up and began taking an order while pointing to the credit card stickers, which I took to mean they accept credit cards.  I wasn't particularly keen on being ignored in favor of the phone, however.\n\nAfter a couple minutes, another guy who'd been cooking (the owner, I suspect) came up and took my order.  I asked him if everything was a la carte, but he told me the fish sandwich ($7.49 w/ tax) comes with fries and coleslaw.  I also asked for his recommendation concerning the fish (they have whiting, tilapia, and catfish), and he recommended catfish, so I decided to go with that. He told me it'd be about 10-15 min., so I braved the cold to go back to my apt. to use the bathroom before heading back.\n\nWhen I headed back, my order was ready, so after returning to my apt., I promptly dug in.  I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed in the sandwich, given that it fell apart after a few bites.  I suspect this may have been due to the lightness of the catfish (I'd never tried catfish before, so I wasn't aware of this) and the bun, which wasn't of the best quality, and was round, rather than long enough to encompass the fish.  The flavor was vastly improved by a liberal application of tartar sauce.  The coleslaw was even more disappointing, due to its overly sweet and creamy nature (I'm not a huge fan of cole slaw, but I prefer the vinegar-based version when I eat it).  However, the fries were surprisingly good, due to the batter on them, which gave them a pleasant crispness (which was perhaps maintained due to picking up the order promptly and living in close proximity).  They were even better with a sprinkle of cider vinegar (I'm not a ketchup girl--sacrilege in the city of Heinz, I know!).\n\nDespite the service snafu and the lackluster fish sandwich, I'd be willing to try this place again for some of the Moroccan specialties, which looked interesting.

I was slightly peeved that the cashier/chef was busy talking on the phone while taking my order. This, however, will not factor into my evaluation.\n\nThe chicken tenders were slabs of chicken breast seasoned in a fashion similar to cajun. They also had sprinkles of white powder on them, which I suspect is MSG. The tenders were anything but tender; they were dry and disappointing. I have had better chicken tenders from cafeterias. The cheese sticks also did not meet expectations.

Low seating with cushions and pillows with curtains making the smoking area's seem more private. Hookah Bookah has none of this.

Ordered on GrubHub and started out not a huge deal, I ordered extra ranch and marinara to go with breadsticks and boneless wings. When the order arrived the driver refused to even enter the hotel lobby. When i arrived back to my room, not only was the food cold, ALL of the sauces were missing. Unfortunately the hotel did not have marinara or ranch that I could purchase. I called the restaurant and asked if they could send the sauces. The man who answered the phone stated he would send them as soon as a driver arrived back. 20 minutes went by and it was my first meal of the day, so I just ate the food. I called the restaurant back to ask them to cancel the missing items as they were no longer needed. A different man answered the phone and rudely told me to wait. He handed the phone to yet another gentleman who the proceeded to call me a liar and began to scream at me stating they were never actually going to deliver the missing sauces as I had been lying about them not being in the box the entire time. I would never order here again. The boneless wings were way over cooked and spongy and the breadsticks were bland and tough.

At the bottom of the receipt it says, \"Collect 10 Different Receipts To Receive Free Med Cheese Pizza\".  If you were to order the above items individually you would end up paying an additional $6.17 so if you have a coupe of people that are hungry and you can agree on what type of hoagie to split, this is a decent solution.  \n\nAs far as the food, it's average.  The breadsticks are good but there's never enough butter / garlic / cheese on them.  The pizza is good but you can taste that the sauce is canned - I only know of two pizza shops in the city that actually makes their own sauce (and that doesn't mean opening the can and pouring it into a bowl).

Ordered at 1:02pm & it's now 1:15pm. I want a fresh review. Ordered a catfish 3 piece dinner that comes on bread with fries & coleslaw. Also ordered a slice of Raspberry cheesecake.)\n\nDelivery came at 1:51pm.\n\nEverything I ordered was there. \n\nVisual inspection:\n\nComes with pita not bread! Definitely a plus for me.\nCould tell immediately the french fries were just your standard cheap frozen fries. Nothing special and not what I prefer. \nFish looked ok, nothing special, cheesecake looked fine. Didn't even see the tiny container of cole slaw til I started eating.\n\nTaste: \n\nCatfish was your typical frozen fishy taste. Breading had no flavor whatsoever. Threw it on the pita with some tarter & hot sauce and tasted a lot better. You get no lemon at all. Guess they prefer to save money and still charge $11.99.\nFries as stated, just your average frozen. Not a fan of them. Ended up covering them with franks hot sauce & ranch & they were good that way lol.\nCole slaw was probably the most disgusting cole slaw I've ever eaten in my entire life, & I love some good slaw. Being thrown in with the fish & fries it was just warm mush.\nCheesecake wasn't bad. Probably would of been better if I threw it back in the fridge since it came hot sitting on my food container.\n\nAll in all, it felt like an average diy dinner purchased from Aldis. Edible but nothing was beyond ok. (no offense to Aldis) The menu here is just ridiculous. Probably the longest pizza place menu I've ever seen in my life. Being a fan of kitchen nightmares it makes me think to that. The more you offer the more you skimp on quality ingredients. Think restaurants like Red Lobster & Olive Garden have smaller menus.\n\nWill definitely order again & try something different. 2 star review off one order isn't really fair but I'll edit it later based off future purchases.\n\n12/13 edit: Was going to order an x-large specialty pizza & was looking for extra ranch. Really, on your 900 item menu I can't order a few extra? Get with it. Yeah, it's stupid & I could call but that's the point of online ordering. I don't have to.

I guess you could say that's what I use to compare. I have to say that even if the pizza was awful, I'd at least be calling Potenza to order their chicken parm hoagie! It's that good. Large pieces of breaded chicken, good sauce, and a nice balance of cheese that isn't too overwhelming. Not to mention the large is big enough to feed a few people...or one of me.\n\nFortunately, the pizza is really good, as well. We've only had cheese, and recently tried the white pizza. Is it the best plain cheese pizza in Pittsburgh? Nope (our nod goes to Fiori's), but you're not going to have any complaints. It's very good for your run-of-the-mill pizza place in town, a la Milano's or Parma, and the white pizza was excellent!\n\nThe other great thing has been the delivery. We seem to get a call from every delivery person - regardless of who we order from - asking about where our place is. Potenza's drivers seem to be the nicest ones we've had to deal with.\n\nIn short, if you're looking for a pizza joint with consistent quality and service, Potenza is a safe bet...and seriously...best chicken parm hoagie that I've found more recently in Pittsburgh.\n"}, {"author": "Faith A.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2012-02-15", "description": "A hidden gem!!!

We will most likely not be back to this location.\n"}, {"author": "Paige L.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2018-02-23", "description": "This is becoming such a go-to spot for us! We came in tonight and ended up putting in a table on the no wait app. It only took a few minutes and we were seated quite quickly. \nBrooke was our server and she was incredible. She was efficient and super nice. She made sure we got a drink in before happy hour was over and she even brought us extra pico de Gallo for our chips. She is a real hustler! \nWhen it was time to order, obviously I was a little difficult and she didn't sweat. I also sent her on a man hunt to find a dressing that is free of animal products and she had no problem at all helping me out. She came back with the red wine vinegar dressing. \nOur beers came fast as super cold with a fresh orange slice ! \nI had the garden patch salad with fries and my hubby had the fish Sammy for lent. We loved every bite!\n"}, {"author": "Angela G.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-11-01", "description": "Love Primanti's! My sandwich was so fresh, just like always. My only complaint with the Mt.

The last (multiple) times ordering food to take home from here, every SINGLE item ordered was incorrect in some way. And their terrible online ordering service does not show an accurate time.

It's tradition right?!? Now that we live here we figured it's no different. \n\nThe first time we went, we had a horrible experience, however the new manager James (I think) was super cordial and took care of us. What surprised me the most is that our food runner of all people was the one who stopped back to check on us and made sure everything was ok. When we expressed our concerns she was apologetic and eager to remedy our situation. If it wasn't for her professionalism and her going out of her way to assist us and demonstrating superior hospitality, I'm not sure we would have gone back any time soon. We didn't see our server much and he seemed too busy to be chatty, so at the end of the meal we had a conversation with the food runner and found out her name was Legacy. She told us she was a server and we vowed to ask for her the next time we came in. \n\nWell, unbeknownst to me, I ended up back at Primanti's the very next evening when my Aunt called and invited us to meet her and her family for dinner. I of course asked for the sweet girl who helped us the night before. There were 6 of us and we were high maintenance always needing a drink refill, more food or something. She handled our table with the utmost ease and never missed a beat. It's SO nice to find a server on top of her game like that. She singlehandedly created a table of regulars! \n\nAlso the food was amazing! It came out fast, hot and cooked to perfection! I really enjoyed the nachos and wings! I am looking forward to all the weekly specials and happy hours in my future, not to mention games! Go Steelers!!!! \n\nThank you and keep up the good work!!!!!\n"}, {"author": "Robert U.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2018-06-20", "description": "This place is a solid 3.  I've been here several times, and I'll probably visit again.  Here's my take:\n\nGOOD:\n- It's quite big.  Lots of tables.  Bar is huge.\n- It's got a neat feel inside.  It's a very old lodge, converted to a restaurant, so there are big, wooden beams in the ceiling, a giant stone fireplace, and some cool animal heads on the wall, staring at you while you eat.\n- The food is consistent and good.  The big sammies are just like the ones in the Strip District.\n- The menu is LARGE, with lots more stuff than they offer at the original location (e.g., entree salads, wings, pizza, nachos, burgers, etc.).\n\nNOT SO GOOD:\n- The parking lot is not quite large enough to accommodate the large size inside.  And given the location, there are no street-parking or other alternatives.  If you can't park, you can't eat.\n- The floor and some of the booths are just a little STICKY!  Is this place really that clean?  Mercifully, it's dimly lighted, so I can't really see what might scare me under good lighting...\n- Some of the servers act like they'd rather be elsewhere.  Others are good.  Hit or miss on service.\n"}, {"author": "Peter G.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-05-08", "description": "My memories of enjoying late-night sandwiches at their site in the Strip District pop up every time I enter one of their newer establishments.  This Primantis location in Mt. Lebanon is great.  The table wait may be long at times, but I almost always find a spot around the bar.\n\nThey promote their No. 2 best seller, but hands down, their best sandwich is the giant fish and cheese with an egg.  If you're not from Pittsburgh, you cannot escape without eating the slaw and fries on your sandwich.  Don't try avoiding the sandwich as intended.\n"}, {"author": "Dom D.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-04-27", "description": "Best primantis I've been to out of all of the others that are not the original.

I absolutely love the atmosphere in this location - it has almost a cabin feel to it. And the best part, there is rarely a wait to sit!\n\nThe staff at this location is always super friendly and quick. I actually enjoy the food at this one over other Primanti Bros. locations. I usually just get the bacon & cheese sandwich with an egg.\n\nThe only downfall to this location that I want to point out - it is noisy and a little cramped in spots. The last time we were here, we were sat right by the front door, with their arcade golf game right behind us as well as the bathroom. People kept walking past and a group of 5 kids decided to play the arcade game, so it wasn't ideal seating.\n\nOverall, I 100% prefer this location over city ones. No wait, great tasting food, and the staff is quick.

So delicious!! However, our server Meghan was literally miserable. Granted we did come in pretty close to the kitchen closing, but we had come from an event and knew what we wanted immediately. I don't think this girl smiled one time. Brought our check with our meals. Never checked in. Never asked if we needed anything. Stopped her for some silver ware and she literally rolled her eyes. Ok Meghan, God forbid you do your job. It hasn't been the first time we had her as a server and her attitude mimicked last experience as well. \nAs a member of the service industry I understand a lot goes on a customer doesn't see, and a late table can be frustrating but at least pretend to care; even a little.\n"}, {"author": "Lorenzo V.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2019-06-16", "description": "I ate here and people made it sound like it was gunna be this amazing thing and that I would eat here all the time...the food was good the prices were fair I guess but def not cheap for sandwich style food and the atmosphere was nice, great service lots of TV's yet I only went once.\n"}, {"author": "Blake W.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-01-15", "description": "The food here was really good and so was the Service. \nI have been here 2 times do to me being from Ohio but the last 2 times I have been in town I have made it a point to stop here. \nI would definitely recommend it!! \nThere is stuff on there menu for just about anyone. \nThey got use also in there fast even with a busy night so that's all ways nice.\n"}, {"author": "Maria J.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2017-04-19", "description": "I know Primanti's is a major Pittsburgh favorite but I personally am not a fan of coleslaw so I don't really like them!

Pretzel app basket comes with nacho cheese and 2 different types of mustard. The pretzels were nice because they weren't fried and actually not bad. \n\nOur server was quick and polite. Prices pretty cheap. Three of us are for $40 including 4 beers (during happy hour). Cleanliness was average with nothing terrible but we did walk through spilled fries to our seat on the way in. \n\nThe atmosphere is nothing special and just reminds me of any chain restaurant.

Me and my gf came here for a date night and it was a big let down. On entering we stood at the door way for almost five minutes as a lady kept walking past with no greeting. Finely a guy comes over who was maybe a manager or someone other than a normal server seats us in the back corner right next to the kitchen doors. So next we wait another ten or fifteen minutes and again finely someone decided to approach us and greet us after walking past a couple times. And he's not even our server he says he's running other tables and gets us drinks and forgets straws and lemons but takes our order and walks away so then we wait for that. Waiting still to meet our actual server as we wait almost twenty minutes for our food. As we are sitting here I can see directly into the kitchen and a cook behind the line with his green hat backwards and headphones in and a navy blueish shirt on is clearly eating food with no gloves on while cooking. Like how is that ok? That's a huge issue with food safety and health regulations but clearly no one seems to care as he continues. Our server ended up being a lady named Casey. She came by twice once to give us food and once to give the check. I'm so disappointed in the service we received during this trip and it's disappointing and a huge turn off with the staff eating behind the line while cooking. I really hope another guest has to sit in that spot and watch like I did.\n"}, {"author": "Sara B.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-06-13", "description": "Always fresh and delicious!

Our waitress was so good and on top of everything.  She even stepped away as our kids gave their Mom a card and present.  \nThe food was good and is the standard Primanti's which we enjoy but I do realize not everyone wants fries on there sandwich.  We started with some wings that were good and piping hot.  I had PB Rueben, that was really enjoyable and not to many calories, lol.  All in all, a fun place to celebrate.\n"}]}
